## Knowledge in the image of inquiry

C.S. Pierce famously held that truth is the end of inquiry. But it isn't truth itself that is to be found at the end of inquiry; instead, it is recognition and acceptance of the truth that the inquirer after. And proper inquiry is rule governed both because following the rules has a practical advantage of more frequently achieving the goal, and also because merely achieving the goal does not justify the practice. Undertaking the process of inquiry is important to earning the accolades that come with possessing the truth. Inquiry is a belief justifying process. So, it may be more appropriate to say that *knowledge* is the end of inquiry.

If so, what implications for the nature of knowledge does this idea carry? I propose to investigate this question by using the model of discourse dynamics developed earlier as characterizing the basic structure of proper inquiry, and to take at face value the idea that the outputs of the process of inquiry are knowledge.

It turns out that this idea has important consequences for explaining the distinctive value of knowledge over true belief, and for the contextualism/relativism debate in epistemology.

## The structure of knowledge

The *knowledge rule of assertion* is the proposal that it is a constitutive norm of assertion that one only assert what one knows. Jonathan Schaffer (2008) asks what comes of knowledge when we take the knowledge rule of assertion seriously. His answer is that, since assertion is best seen as taking place within a discourse context structured by the question under discussion (QUD), and the QUD is best represented by the set of its alternative answers, knowledge is similarly relativized to a set of alternatives to the proposition known. And this makes knowledge look a lot like the contrastivist proposal would have it.

Schaffer's proposal to limn the structure of knowledge by investigating the structure of assertion is motivated by the suggested connection between knowledge and assertion. As Timothy Williamson puts the idea, "it is pointless to ask why the knowledge rule is the rule of assertion. It could not have been otherwise" (2000 p. 267). Knowledge is strongly modally tied to assertion, and modal connections generally bring structural similarity in their wake. Of course, structural similarity is a symmetric relation, and it is feasible to adjust our conception of the structure of assertion to match a particular account of knowledge. But with a well developed theory of assertion in the offing, it is reasonable to let it inform our conception of knowledge.

Similarly, knowledge is not a mere incidental consequence of inquiry. Inquiry is designed with a specific eye toward producing knowledge. In fact, we can provide an operational definition of inquiry as that (any) process whose output is, *ceteris paribus*, knowledge. Properly conducted inquiry results in knowledge properly conceived. If we take this idea seriously, then the structure of knowledge ought to mirror the structure of the outputs of inquiry, and inquiry, as we've seen from the discussion of discourse dynamics, outputs *information states*, where an information state is an articulated structure involving a context set, a set of relations-in-intension among the elements of the context set, and a domain of discourse referents. 

In addition, if the conjecture/correction process is an essential element of inquiry, then the inputs and outputs operated on over the course of the inquiry are conjectural skeletons whose saturation may develop over the course of the inquiry.

### From epistemic logic to information states

Isaac Levi denies Peirce's characterization of the ultimate end of inquiry as "approaching the true complete story of the world" (Levi 1980, p. 70). His concern is with the idea that ordinary inquiry can be understood in terms of such far-reaching objectives. Instead, he understands the aim of inquiry as *error-avoidance* (p. 71). For Levi, inquiry involves the change of bodies of belief, and the criterion for appropriate such changes is care taken against importing error into one's belief corpus. One need only concern herself with this immediate change.

Though his characterization of the aim of inquiry is different, the end result is the same. Assuming that proper inquiry doesn't result in the expansion of one's belief corpus with merely incidentally error free information, the end of inquiry is knowledge.

But Levi does not think that this requires us to represent belief bodies (my *information states*) with an articulated structure. Instead, Levi takes the standard approach of epistemic logic in which an information state (&#x1d472;) is represented by a deductively closed set (&#x1d43e;) of interpreted sentences of some language (&#x1d50f;). This is the syntactic standpoint on information states. We can equivalently represent them semantically by assuming a domain of points representing maximal, consistent sets of sentences of &#x1d50f;, and treating each &#x1d43e; as an equivalence class of such points relative to the agent's beliefs. In this way, an agent's information state is their "standard for serious possibility" (Levi 1980, p. 8), represented as a set of possible worlds amongst which their knowledge does not decide.

Levi holds a conservatist view of knowledge. Knowledge, says Levi, is not a matter of *pedigree* (the origins or first principles of its genesis), it is a matter of improvement. Agents needn't be able to justify the composition of their information state as it is; they need only provide justification for the changes they make to it.  Thus, justification is provided by way of a comparison of information states, and is not an element thereof.

But Levi does have the commitment of accounting for the difference between changes that *improve* one's information state from those that make it no better. Only the former are motivated, and justification must be provided to demonstrate that a change is in that category. Let's call any change made to an information state a *revision*. Given the structure of information states as Levi understands them, all revisions are represented by set theoretic operations. The two principle such operations are set intersection, which represents an *expansion* of the information state -- acquiring information involves eliminating worlds from one's consideration as a genuine possibility; and set union, which represents *contraction* -- withdrawing belief and thereby becoming uncertain about some proposition involves adding worlds to one's set of considered possibilities. According to Levi, and what has become known as the *Levi Identity*, all revisions are reducible to some combination of *expansion* and *contraction*.

Then the problem of justification, then, is to specify the properties of the expansion and contraction operators such that all warranted changes in belief are subsumed under their operation. For Levi, knowledge is both the beginning and end of inquiry, and the process of inquiry is transition between such states, characterized by principles of appropriate expansion and contraction.

#### Expansion

Expansion is the easier of the two operations to understand. Syntactically, the operation involves adding a sentence to the information state and taking the dedctive closure on the result. Semantically, this is just the intersection of the state of information with the state representing the expansion proposition. Given the deductive closure constraint on information states, there is only one viable expansion operation. 

#### Contraction

There is more room for nuance in specifying the contraction operation, for there is more than one way to remove information from the information state.

### The impetus to revise

On the picture of inquiry developed by Levi, inquiry both begins and ends in knowledge. As such, each state is as valuable as any other, and there is no inherent impetus to revise one's state. That's true so long as one avoids falling into the trivial state, in which deductive closure forces an expansion of the information state to properly include &#x1d50f;, a state referred to as *epistemic hell*. As long as one avoids epistemic hell, the specification of states of information plus a revision operator tells us nothing about when one ought to revise.

This is perhaps fine with Levi, whose stated view of inquiry is as a means to error avoidance. If one never revises, one never risks importing error. But, following William James, error avoidance is only one epistemic virtue; there is also the goal of acquiring truth.

## The Meno problem

One way of understanding the Meno Problem is as presenting the challenge of explaining what makes the state of knowledge more valuable thatn the corresponding state of mere true belief. On this characterization, the presupposition is that there is an intrinsic value-relevant difference between knowledge and mere-true-belief. It is this presupposition that drives questions of the adequacy of reliabilist accounts of justification. For it is presumed that, intrinsically, the outputs of a reliable process are no different from those of an unreliable one. They are both just beliefs. 

There is no shortage of responses to the Meno Problem. Some have tried to take the issue head on by suggesting that the state of knowledge is different from mere-true-belief, perhaps in terms of their modal profiles, and that this difference grounds the value difference in an intrinsic feature of knowledge.

Others have denied the presupposition, suggesting that value need not attach to intrinsic properties of states. For instance, it is natural to maintain that knowledge is not a mere product, but a product *of this reliable belief forming process*. This approach is similar to that advocated by those who take personal identity to determined by mental states arising *from this brain*, or those who take just distributive policies to be those that follow from principles settled upon *by the participants in the original position*. On this view, knowledge is operationally defined. It's value is grounded in its formation history, but this is not an independent feature, for knowledge is a state conjoined with a causal history.

### Zagzebski on the value problem

Linda Zagzebski's characterization of what she calls *the value problem* is that all definitions of knowledge that take it to be a value conferring property conjoined to a state of true belief will end up having the value of the conjoined property swamped by the value provided merely by the truth of the belief.

This is especially acute for what Zagzebski calls *machine-product* accounts of knowledge, on which knowledge is taken to be a state that is the output of some state generating process.

But the externalist element of these accounts is not the source of the worry, because internalist accounts that interpret the difference between justified and merely true belief in terms of *truth-conduciveness* also submit to the value problem. Once truth is achieved, truth-conduciveness provides nothing extra. Zagzebski directly addresses Lawrence Bonjour's approach to justification, but the challenge would seemingly apply also to modal accounts such as Williamson's *safety* account. If my belief is true in this world, I get little more out of it also being true in nearby worlds.

The moral Zagzebski takes from the value problem is that we must dismiss the machine-product view of knowledge and accept knowledge as a property of temporally extended agents.

But the problem isn't with the machine-product model itself. The problem has to do with the nature of the product. We can imbue the product with the credit deserving feature --  the *account* of the state's genesis. The problem is not the product, but that the process is seen as external to the product. But the insight of dynamic semantics is that these need not be independent. The product encodes the process.

Of course, there is still an issue with the unity of knowledge. Why don't we still have a swamping issue, just now with one part of knowledge swamping the value provided by another part? The answer has to do with the idea of truth-conduciveness as value adding. We have an operational account of knowledge; we also understand truth operationally.

Conduciveness is not a modal property. It is dynamic. Take Meno's first take reposne to Socrates: "The man who has knowledge will get there every time, whereas the man with true opinion will get there only sometimes." I think this is the most natural characterization of the value of knowledge, and it is also the correct one. This is because knowledge isn't valuable as a destination; it is valuable as a means to a destination.

A holistic, dynamic state encodes the process of inquiry, and this is knowledge. The individual beliefs abstracted from the state are known, but they are not the knowledge in so far as knowledge is value additive.

In the belief update literature, knowledge is understood as the fixation of belief. It is the set of worlds to which one does not consider alternatives. This perspective is unlikely to capture the colloquial English use of the word "knowledge", for knowledge of this sort is not factive. But of additional concern for this account is the ability to set off a concept distinct from belief. 

Knowledge is belief with an account.

Zagzebski suggests that the problem is that the value adding function is also the function that produces the belief. But if its value comes from its proficiency at producing true beliefs, then it's value is also swamped by the truth of its product.

We can then (i) deny the machine-product model, (ii) devise another value for the production mechanism that is independent of the intrinsic properties of the end product, or (iii) expand the product to include parts that are both independently valuable and dependent upon the production means.

Ways Zagzebski explains the problem:
  
+ The external nature of the value adding property (unity)
+ The fact that the value adding function is the producing function, and that the product has the value intrinsically (swamping)
+ The machine-product model

Zagzebski's morals of the value problem

1. Truth plus a reliable source of truth cannot explain the value of knowledge

  + The value of truth, which the belief has intrinsically, swamps any value provided by a belief forming method that reliably produces truths.

2. Truth plus an independently valuable source cannot explain the value problem.

  + Value had by a cause need not transfer to its effects. 

3. Knowing is not related to the knower as a machine to a product

  + If all knowing is is a kind of belief forming process, then it's value is completely swamped by the value intrinsic to the product.
  
Zagzebski's alternative: Knowledge has value in conferring credit on the agent for the belief. It is not the output of an agent, it is a state of the agent.The agent is made better by believing in the way she does. The model for this is action. Acts are not products of agents, they are parts of agents because they include the intention. Thus, to get credit for an action is to value the agent for one of her intrinsic properties. Knowledge is similarly an intrinsic property of agents. As in action, belief is motivated, and the motivation makes the belief a property of the agent.

Zagzebski's fn. 12 alternative: Knowledge is an organic unity containing both the belief and its formation process. The value of the whole thereby exceeds the value of the belief part.

JTB analyses do not in general succumb to the value problem: Justification is something added to the belief. The belief (itself) is justified. Thus, the belief is made better by the justification coferring process.

 + But truth-conducivity accounts of justification do succumb. For, it's value is then in the product it brings about, and the product swamps it.
 
Of course, the point of further iterations of the reliabilist family of theories is an attempt to capture the modal character of reliability. And this modeal property is thought to be a property *of the belief*. The belief is stable, or safe, or sensitive, because of its relation to truth in different worlds. Not because of the properties possessed by different beliefs modally produced by the belief forming mechanism.

### The external relation version of the value problem

The genuine moral of the value problem has to do with the external character of the proposed value adding property when knowledge is conceived of as a particular kind of belief state. The value added is swamped by the state already possessing the property it adds. But bringing the value adding element *into* the product is no progress if it is swamped by another of the product's *parts*. The challenge is to say what *distinctive* value knowledge has over true opinion.

The answer is to characterize differently the nature of knowledge. It doesn't work for it to be a sub-kind of belief. But we needn't dismiss the useful machine-product model. We need only reconceive the product. We are left with an articulated state, and the threat of swamping looms anew. What we need is *value unity* that does not reduce to truth.

### Breaking the problem down

There are two parts that are needed for a complete response to the external property version of the value problem. 

1. The value making property
2. The nature of the value

The adequacy criteria on the second element are that the value not reduce to, or be swamped by the truth of the belief state to which it is applied, and that it stem from the value making property.

If knowledge is an articulated state combining a fixated domain and an account, then what unifies it as a distinctly valuable state? In what sense is knowledge an *organic unity*? I suggest that it is the same feature that explains its distinction from mere belief states. It is operationally defined truth-conduciveness. 

*Truth-conduciveness* is a modal notion. It is valuable not in producing truth, but in its tendency  to produce truth. We can understand this either practically (in terms of proven past success) or operationally (with truth just being that thing generally produced by this procedure).^[consider Mill on the value of expressive freedom. It is valuable even when truth has been obtained. This is the case because truth attainment is not the value; maintaining support for the truth is.]

### Williamson on the value of knowledge

Knowledge provides stability with respect to future action (2000, p. 79-80). One who knows is in a better position to distrust misleading evidence. There is also an explanatory loss in moving from knowledge involving language to rational-true-belief involving language in explaining behavior. Why did the burglar look so long despite the risk of being caught? Because he knew they were in the house (p. 62). The probability of an action conditional on their knowing is greater than the probability of the action conditional on their merely truly believing.

Subjective certainty cannot replace knowing. Fixation of belief must allow for undoing.

### The options

1. Knowledge as additional instrumental value:
  
  + Modally conceived
  + Structurally conceived
  + As providing stability for future action
  + As providing a ground for practical reasoning
  + 

2. Knowledge as conferring an intrinsic property upon its bearer:
  
  + Making an agent worthy of praise for belief
  + Making a belief justified
