# Relativism as indeterminacy

To say that something is relative is to say that the objective facts do not determine its truth value. If we accept this and that the openness comes from the judge/perspective position, then we need a system that has a mechanism for contextual variation of perspectives but that does not bake in the means of determining which perspective is relavant at any point.

But evaluation will always require that some perspective *is* relevant. This is the location for defaults to assert themselves.

# Mechanisms of coordination

It is well accepted that mutual understanding requires coordination of interlocutors contexts. Stalnaker characterizes this as an *anticipatory presupposition* on behalf of the speaker that the hearer will adjust her context to accommodate the speaker's sentence at the point of interpretation.

But if we delve more into the issue of coordination, we see that its regularity calls for a mechanism to explain the warrant behind the speaker's presupposition. And its complexity calls for adjustment of the underlying structure of the discourse record. The mechanism is not simply plug-and-play. For the basis of coordination is a convention of truthfulness and trust. This convention is bi-directional, and so, too, is the responsiveness of the discourse record.

# Stalnaker's common ground

Has the structure of common knowledge and belief -- an accessibility relation over possibilities that is "the transitive closure of the accessibility relations for a notion of *acceptance for the purposes of the conversation*". This notion is much like belief -- one accepts that they accept what they accept and accepts that they don't when they don't.

Common ground is what is *presumed* to be common knowledge, which normally, is all that which someone believes, though pretense may be called for in the conversation.

*norm of agreement*, grounded in Grice's cooperative principle, is an inclination to adjust one's acceptance set to match her interlocutors' as it becomes necessary. Associated with this norm is a warranted presupposition on the part of the speaker that the hearer will do so.

This norm of agreement provides the warrant for speaker presupposition. But this is a decededly one-way affair. And conversation is not strictly controlled by the speaker. There are attested instances where the hearer can force agreement with her own acceptance set. These are instances of dispute/contrast. Under the current model we have just presupposition failure to capture this. But presupposition failure is a coarse model, and predicts disaster for the conversation. (Stalnaker "to reject something that has been presupposed requires an explicit recognition that the game has gone off course".) This prediction is not usually realized. 

Instead, the speaker easily back-adjusts her acceptance set. This is motivated by another norm of conversation -- a *norm of trust* -- and this, too, is grounded in general principles of conversation. Though, I think we must go beyond Grice's notion of cooperation to one of collaboration. And the tools we must introduce to capture action under the norm involve a structure that goes beyond the accessibility relation model of common ground.

# von Fintel on presupposition accommodation

> "Thus, we have (i) that (6) presupposes that Phoebe has a cat, i.e. it requires that the common ground it is to be added to entails that Phoebe has a cat; (ii) that Phoebe in asserting (6) presupposes that she has a cat, i.e. that she assumes that common ground that (6) is to be added to entails that she has a cat; (iii) that Phoebe does not assume that the hearers already before her utterance presuppose that she has a cat; (iv) that she trusts that the hearers will change their assumptions in time for (6) to be added to the common ground; (v) that the hearers can figure out that (i)-(iv) hold and will accommodate Phoebe if they are willing."

The speaker's trust of the hearer to accommodate is crucial. The same goes in the other direction. The speaker trusts the hearer to object if it is necessary. And as trust opens up an efficiency mechanism (presuppostion) it opens another efficiency mechanism (conjecture).

# Generalized coordination

+ **Presupposition**: Backgrounding of information is valuable as a way of filtering the important from the necessary but ancillary.
+ **Conjecture**: Positing hypotheses is valuable as a way of initiating discussion. Inquiry needs a rolling ball.

> The common ground theory (together with its explication of the phenomenon of accommodation) says that one can presuppose p as long as it is assumed that the hearer will not want to dispute p.

On the flip side, the sandbox theory (together with a proposed structure for initiating sentences) says that one can conjecture p *because* it is assumed that the hearer may want to dispute p.

The more general phenomenon is proferring; whether it is presupposition or conjecture is a matter of function and response. And it needn't be clear beforehand. Trust just is trust that together the interlocutors will come to an agreement. We throw things out there. If they get accommodated, we act as if they were common ground. If they get rejected, we set to defending them. If they get corrected, we come to a suitably shifted compromise common ground.

But the key point is that the undivided common ground is too coarse a tool for conjecture and correction. We need more than just secondary propositions that are carried alongside the at-issue content and backgrounded. We also need access to parts of propositions, so that we can fiddle with them.

# Common ground, presupposition, and conjecture

Stalnaker offers an elegant conception of the conversational scoreboard. Conversation is both responsive to and modifies a common ground composed of possibilities compatible with the shared assumptions of the conversational participants. This is a loose characterization; many of its parts need spelling out. But it is also powerful.

Still, I think that it is too simplistic. We need additional structure to capture some of the nuances of information exchange in conversation.

Nuances
+ Ordering (structuring) relation for entrenchment, imperatives, not-at-issue, etc
+ Dref set (structured) for anaphoric relations
+ Accessibility relation on common ground for modal relations

My proposal is along the same lines: There is a linguistic phenomenon that is robust enough that it calls for a new development within the theoretical structure of conversational scoreboards. 

+ The surfance phenomenon is attested in conversation by Clark and others.
+ It is like presupposition, assertion, and questioning in that involves rules for modifying the common ground as a whole rather than the particular pieces that go into it.
+ Presupposition puts constraints on the common ground (constraints can also be met by accommodation)
+ But our pheonomenon is more nuanced than presupposition. For the responses to it are not merely accept or reject -- there is also *correct*.
+ Note that the argument here is not that there are some intuitive presuppositions that aren't captured; I accept the accommodation based dissolution of the projection problem. 
+ Rather, the issue is that there is more we can do with backgrounded information than merely presuppose. We can also conjecture.
