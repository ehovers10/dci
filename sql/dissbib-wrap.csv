Structured Anaphora to Quantifier Domains: A Unified Account of Quantificational and Modal Subordination,Adrian Brasoveanu,unpublished,,n/a,,,,,brasoveanua,,,,,,,,,,"The paper proposes an account of the contrast noticed in Karttunen 1976 between the interpretations of the following two discourses: Harvey courts a girl at every convention. She is very pretty. vs. She always comes to the banquet with him. . The initial sentence is ambiguous between two quantifier scopings, but the first discourse as a whole allows only for the wide-scope indefinite reading, while the second allows for both. This cross-sentential interaction between quantifier scope and anaphora is captured by means of a new dynamic system couched in classical type logic, which extends Compositional DRT Muskens 1996 with plural information states modeled, following van den Berg 1996, as sets of variable assignments . Given the underlying type logic, compositionality at sub-clausal level follows automatically and standard techniques from Montague semantics become available. The paper also shows that modal subordination A wolf might come in. It would eat Harvey first can be analyzed in a parallel way, i.e. the system captures the anaphoric and quantificational parallels between the individual and modal domains argued for in Stone 1999 among others . In the process, we see that modal / individual-level quantifiers enter anaphoric connections as a matter of course, usually functioning simultaneously as both indefinites and pronouns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the model we propose, the speaker initiates the process by presenting or inviting a noun phrase. Before going on to the next contribution, the participants, if necessary, repair, expand on, or replace the noun phrase in an iterative process until they reach a version they mutually accept. In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced. The model follows, we suggest, from the mutual responsibility that participants in conversation bear toward the understanding of each utterance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Epistemic Modals, Relativism and Assertion",Andy Egan,article,Philosophical Studies,2007,1,1-22,133,https://app.box.com/s/iuee3fw6ppj2bb3oirle4w36wyx3c8vj,egan2007a,,,,,,,,,,"I think that there are good reasons to adopt a relativist semantics for epistemic modal claims such as ``the treasure might be under the palm tree, according to which such utterances determine a truth value relative to something finer-grained than just a world or a $<$world, time$>$ pair . Anyone who is inclined to relativise truth to more than just worlds and times faces a problem about assertion. It s easy to be puzzled about just what purpose would be served by assertions of this kind, and how to understand what we d be up to in our use of sentences like ``the treasure might be under the palm tree, if they have such peculiar truth conditions. After providing a very quick argument to motivate a relativist view of epistemic modals, I bring out and attempt to resolve this problem in making sense of the role of assertions with relativist truth conditions. Solving this problem should be helpful in two ways: first, it eliminates an apparently forceful objection to relativism, and second, spelling out the relativist account of assertion and communication will help to make clear just what the relativist position is, exactly, and why it s interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is widely agreed that the simple theory will not work in some cases, but the counterexamples produced so far seem amenable to a more complicated contextualist theory. We argue, however, that no contextualist theory can capture the evaluations speakers naturally make of sentences containing epistemic modals. If we want to respect these evaluations, our best option is a relativist theory of epistemic modals. On a relativist theory, an utterance of a might be F can be true relative to one context of evaluation and false relative to another. We argue that such a theory does better than any rival approach at capturing all the behaviour of epistemic modals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Context and the Composition of Meaning,Jan van Eijck,unpublished,,2003,,,,,eijck,,,,,,,,,,"Key ingredients in discourse meaning are reference markers: objects in the formal representation that the discourse is about. It is well-known that reference markers are not like { } rst order variables. Indeed, it is the received view that reference markers are like the variables in imperative programming languages. However, in a computational semantics of discourse that treats reference markers as 	extquoteleft { } dynamically bound	extquoteright variables, every noun phrase will get linked to a dynamic variable, so it will give rise to a marker index. Where do these indices come from? How do we handle them when combining or 	extquoteleft { } merging	extquoteright pieces of discourse? We will argue that reference markers are better treated as indices into context, and we will present a theory of context and context extension based on this view. In context semantics, noun phrases do not come with { } xed indices, so the merge problem does not arise. This solves a vexing issue with coordination that causes trouble for all current versions of compositional discourse representation theory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first part I present the binding theory of presupposition projection, which is the framework that I adopt in this paper Section 1.1 . I outline the main problems that arise in the interplay between presuppositions and anaphors on the one hand and attitude reports on the other Section 1.2, and discuss Heim s theory of presuppositions in attitude contexts Section 1.3 .In the second part of the paper I present my own proposal. To begin with, I define an extension of DRT in which attitude reports can be represented Sections 2.1-{ } 2.2 . I then argue that the verb believe triggers a certain presupposition and that, given the binding theory, this presupposition determines the projection behaviour of the verb Section 2.3 . This analysis yields predictions which are incomplete in the sense that they do not fully account for speakers intuitions about presuppositions and anaphors in belief contexts. In Section 2.4 I suggest that this is as it should be because we may assume on independent grounds that there is a class of plausibility inferences which complement the predictions of the presupposition theory. Finally, the analysis is extended to the verb want Section 2.5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dynamic Predicate Logic,Jeroen Groenendijk and Martin Stokhof,article,Linguistics and Philosophy,1991,1,39-100,14,https://app.box.com/s/ordtsi00dz6qr0ih0t3xkmrysyezwcpe,groenendijk1991,,,,,,,,,,"This paper is devoted to the formulation and investigation of a dynamic semantic interpretation of the language of { } rst-order predicate logic. The resulting system, which will be referred to as 	extquoteleft { } dynamic predicate logic	extquoteright, is intended as a { } rst step towards a compositional, non-representational theory of discourse semantics. In the last decade, various theories of discourse semantics have emerged within the paradigm of model-theoretic semantics. A common feature of these theories is a tendency to do away with the principle of compositionality, a principle which, implicitly or explicitly, has dominated semantics since the days of Frege. Therefore the question naturally arises whether non-compositionality is in any way a necessary feature of discourse semantics. Since we subscribe to the interpretation of compositionality as constituting primarily a methodological principle, we consider this to be a methodological rather than an empirical question. As a consequence, the emphasis in the present paper lies on developing an alternative compositional semantics of discourse, which is empirically equivalent to its non-compositional brethren, but which di { } ers from them in a principled methodological way. Hence, no attempts are made to improve on existing theories empirically. Nevertheless, as we indicate in section 5, the development of a compositional alternative may in the end have empirical consequences, too. First of all, it can be argued that the dynamic view on interpretation developed in this paper suggests natural and relatively easy to formulate extensions which enable one to deal with a wider range of phenomena than can be dealt with in existing theories. Moreover, the various approaches to the model-theoretic semantics of discourse that have been developed during the last decade, have constituted a 	extquoteleft { } fresh start	extquoteright in the sense that much of what had been accomplished before was ignored, at least for a start. Of course, this is a justi { } ed strategy if one feels one is trying to develop a radically di { } erent approach to recalcitrant problems. However, there comes a time when such new approaches have to be compared with the older one, and when an assessment of the pros and cons of each has to be made. One of the main problems in semantics today, we feel, is that a semantic theory such as Montague grammar, and an approach like Kamp	extquoteright { } s discourse representation theory, are hard to compare, let alone that it is possible to unify their insights and results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The paper examines interactions between local coherence and choice of referring expressions; it argues that differences in coherence correspond in part to the inference demands made by different types of referring expressions given a particular attentional state. It demonstrats that the attentional state properties modelled by centering can account fo these differences.",,,,University of Pennsylvania,,,Institute for Reseach in Cognitive Science,,,,,,,

Situations in Natural Language Semantics,Angelika Kratzer,chapter,,2008,,,,,kratzer2008a,,,1095-5054,The Metaphysics Research Lab,,Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,Edward N. Zalta,,,"Situation semantics was developed as an alternative to possible worlds semantics. In situation semantics, linguistic expressions are evaluated with respect to partial, rather than complete, worlds. There is no consensus about what situations are, just as there is no consensus about what possible worlds or events are. According to some, situations are structured entities consisting of relations and individuals standing in those relations. According to others, situations are particulars. In spite of unresolved foundational issues, the partiality provided by situation semantics has led to some genuinely new approaches to a variety of phenomena in natural language semantics. In the way of illustration, this article includes relatively detailed overviews of a few selected areas where situation semantics has been successful: implicit quantifier domain restrictions, donkey pronouns, and exhaustive interpretations. It moreover addresses the question of how Davidsonian event semantics can be embedded in a semantics based on situations. Other areas where a situation semantics perspective has led to progress include attitude ascriptions, questions, tense, aspect, nominalizations, implicit arguments, point of view, counterfactual conditionals, and discourse relations.",,,,Stanford University,,,CSLI,,,,,,,

If the BPR was true, no more would have to be said about the meaning of focus. The behavior of whatever inferences are generated by backgrounding could be taken care of by theories dealing with the projection of presuppositions of the familiar kind, the presuppositions of definite descriptions, clefts, or factives, for example. This is a non-trivial and interesting claim.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The second part discusses one kind of insufficiency in the meaning definitions given in the first part, which arise from the ex falso quodlibet paradox of logical consequence.

The Semantics and Pragmatics of Presupposition,Nicholas Asher and Alex Lascarides,article,Journal of Semantics,1998,3,239-300,15,,asher1998,,,,,,,,,,"In this paper, we offer a novel analysis of presuppositions, paying particular attention to the interaction between the knowledge resources that are required to The analysis has two main features. First, we capture an analogy between presuppositions, anaphora and scope ambiguity (cf. van der Sandt 1992), by utilizing semantic under-specification (c£ Reyle 1993). Second, resolving this underspecification requires reasoning about how the presupposition is rhetorically connected to the discourse context.This has several consequences. First, since pragmatic information plays a role in computing the rhetorical relation, it also constrains the interpretation of presuppositions. Our account therefore provides a formal framework for analysing problematic data, which require pragmatic reasoning. Second, binding presuppositions to the context via rhetorical links replaces accommodating them, in the sense of adding them to the context (cf. Lewis 1979). The treatment of presupposition is thus generalized and integrated into the discourse update procedure.We formalize this approach in SDRT (Asher 1993; Lascarides & Asher 1993), and demonstrate that it provides a rich framework for interpreting presuppositions, where semantic and pragmatic constraints are integrated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents an analysis of the relationship between imperatives and priority modals in discourse which asserts that, just as declaratives contribute to the Common Ground and thus provide information relevant to the interpre-tation of epistemic modals in subsequent discourse, imperatives contribute to another component of the discourse context, the addressee’s To-Do List, which serves as a contextual resource for the interpretation of priority modals. This analysis predicts that the interpretation of imperatives and modals in discourse is constrained in surprising ways; these predictions are borne out.",,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11050-007-9022-y,,

Next, the meanings of distribu- tivity markers such as each and non-distributivity indicators such as together are considered. An existing analysis of each in terms of quantification over parts of a plurality is adopted. However, together is problematic, for it involves a cancellation or negation of the quantification associated with each. (The four boys together owned exactly three cars could not be true if each of the boys owned three cars, though the same sentence without together could be.) A refinement of this idea of negated quantification over parts is proposed as an analysis for non-distributivity operators. It is then worked out in the system described in Cooper (1983), in which positive and negative extensions are assigned. Presuppositions connected with plural refer- ence are considered at this point as well. Finally, the cumulativity operator is argued to be quantificational and therefore sensitive to contextual domain selection. This context sensitivity is claimed to be the source of distributive readings that appear in the absence of modifiers like each and non-distributive or collective readings that arise without together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spoken corpus examplesreveal that these three possibilities differ in relation to thetype of information they tend to contribute, and this has twoeffects. First, the information status of the fact and its role inthe discourse seem to affect the preference for one constructionover another in a particular context.

On the Representation of Context,Robert Stalnaker,article,"Journal of Logic, Language and Information",1998,1,3-19,7,,stalnaker1998c,,,,Springer Netherlands,,,,,,"This paper revisits some foundational questions concerning the abstract representation of a discourse context. The context of a conversation is represented by a body of information that is presumed to be shared by the participants in the conversation -the information that the speaker presupposes a point at which a speech act is interpreted. This notion is designed to represent both the information on which context-dependent speech acts depend, and the situation that speech acts are designed to affect, and so to be a representation of context that is appropriate for explaining the interaction of context and the contents expressed in them. After reviewing the motivating ideas and the outlines of the apparatus, the paper responds to a criticism of the framework, and considers the way it can help to clarify some phenomena concerning pronouns with indefinite antecedents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enlightened Update: A Computational Architecture for Presupposition and Other Pragmatic Phenomena,Richmond H. Thomason and Matthew Stone and David DeVault,unpublished,,n/a,,,,https://app.box.com/s/1ij581mylhax7m5but72l06dttvkr6xf,thomason,,,,,,,,,,"We relate the theory of presupposition accommodation to a computational framework for reasoning in conversation. We understand presuppositions as private commitments the speaker makes in using an utterance but expects the listener to recognize based on mutual information. On this understanding, the conversation can move forward not just through the positive effects of interlocutors	extquoteright utterances but also from the retrospective insight interlocutors gain about one anothers	extquoteright mental states from observing what they do. Our title, ENLIGHTENED UPDATE, highlights such cases. Our approach fleshes out two key principles: that interpretation is a form of intention recognition; and that intentions are complex informational structures, which specify commitments to conditions and to outcomes as well as to actions. We present a formalization and implementation of these principles for a simple conversational agent, and draw on this case study to argue that pragmatic reasoning is holistic in character, continuous with common-sense reasoning about collaborative activities, and most effectively characterized by associating specific, reliable interpretive constraints directly with grammatical forms. In showing how to make such claims precise and to develop theories that respect them, we illustrate the general place of computation in the cognitive science of language.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The False Hopes of Traditional Epistemology,Bas C. van Fraassen,article,Philosophy and Phenomenological Research,2000,2,253-280,LX,,vanfraassen2000,,,,,,,,,,"After Hume, attempts to forge an empiricist epistemology have taken three forms, which I shall call the First, Middle, and Third Way. The First still attempts an a priori demonstration that our cognitive methods satisfy some (weak) criterion of adequacy. The Middle Way is pursued under the banners of naturalism and scientific realism, and aims at the same conclusion on non-apriori grounds. After arguing that both fail, I shall describe the general characteristics of the Third Way, an alternative epistemology suitable for empiricism.",,,,Princeton University,,,,,,,,,,
