# Introduction of the issue

Plurals are taken to be a class divided twice over. But this division comes at a price. For characterizing generics aren't just quirky, their also fickle. And the nature of their fickleness suggests that there is a gradient of interpretations between kind reference and quantificational readings.

# Survey of existing treatments

We can categorize existing treatments of generics based on the trade-offs they are willing to accept in the tug and pull between quirkiness and fragility.

## Uniformity of LF

Dan Liebesman's simple generics account treats all generics as kind referring, attributing quirkiness to the vagaries the metaphysics of kinds and property instantiation.

Kathrine Koslicki gives us uniformity of LF at one level, positing a higher level at which the specifics of kind predication and

## Conceptual development in characterizing generics

Sarah Jane Leslie and Cohen accept the divide between kind and characterizing. Their focus is on sending quirkiness to conceptual development. This, too, suffers under fragility.

## Pluralities and context

It is often thought that plurals are divided along another dimension between distributive and non-distributive readings. But Roger Schwarzschild shows that a plurality-based account of plural predication can uniformly account for distributivity as long as context is figured in appropriately. The need to do so is all the more acute because distributiviyt and non-distributivity are not two sides of a coin but rather two end points of a continuum. A distinct-readings style approach results in an explosion of meanings.

## Fickleness as collaborative refinement

My proposal is that generics incline toward being uttered as conjectures. When I conjecture, I suggest a simple hypothesis, knowing that it is subject to correction. Correction is thus a part of a coherent development of a shared contribution to the common ground. Semantically, generics are undistinguished predications of a property to a plurality. Quirkiness derives from the collaborative refinement process. If there is no correction, my uniform attribution goes through. But if you contest, you can do so without rejecting my proposal outright, you can refine it by partitioning the subject plurality as you see fit. I, too, can negotiate. The extended negotiation process demands a workspace separate from our conversational scoreboard. For nothing has been mutually accepted yet. The boundaries of this workspace are set by the nature of the continuity between our proposals.
