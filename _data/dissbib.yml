  Title: "Structured Anaphora to Quantifier Domains: A Unified Account of Quantificational and Modal Subordination"
  Author: Adrian Brasoveanu
  Year: n/a
  Abstract: "The paper proposes an account of the contrast noticed in Karttunen 1976 between the interpretations of the following two discourses: Harvey courts a girl at every convention. <em>She is very pretty</em>. vs. <em>She always comes to the banquet with him</em>. . The initial sentence is ambiguous between two quantifier scopings, but the first discourse as a whole allows only for the wide-scope indefinite reading, while the second allows for both. This cross-sentential interaction between quantifier scope and anaphora is captured by means of a new dynamic system couched in classical type logic, which extends Compositional DRT Muskens 1996 with plural information states modeled, following van den Berg 1996, as sets of variable assignments . Given the underlying type logic, compositionality at sub-clausal level follows automatically and standard techniques from Montague semantics become available. The paper also shows that modal subordination A wolf might come in. It would eat Harvey first can be analyzed in a parallel way, i.e. the system captures the anaphoric and quantificational parallels between the individual and modal domains argued for in Stone 1999 among others . In the process, we see that modal / individual-level quantifiers enter anaphoric connections as a matter of course, usually functioning simultaneously as both indefinites and pronouns."

  Title: Referring as a collaborative process
  Author: Herbert H. Clark and Deanna Wilkes-Gibbs
  Year: 1986
  Journal: Cognition
  Pages: 1-39
  Volume: 22
  Abstract: "In conversation, speakers and addressees work together in the making of a definite reference. In the model we propose, the speaker initiates the process by presenting or inviting a noun phrase. Before going on to the next contribution, the participants, if necessary, repair, expand on, or replace the noun phrase in an iterative process until they reach a version they mutually accept. In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced. The model follows, we suggest, from the mutual responsibility that participants in conversation bear toward the understanding of each utterance."

  Editor: Ted Warfield and Richard Feldman
  Abstract: "i$>$ \textquotedblleft { } There\textquoteright { } s no disputing about taste.\textquotedblright That\textquoteright { } s got a nice ring to it, but it\textquoteright { } s not quite the ring of truth. While there\textquoteright { } s definitely something right about the aphorism -there\textquoteright { } s a reason why it is, after all, an aphorism, and why its utterance tends to produce so much nodding of heads and muttering of \textquotedblleft { } just so\textquotedblright and \textquotedblleft { } yes, quite\textquotedblright -it\textquoteright { } s surprisingly difficult to put one\textquoteright { } s finger on just what the truth in the neighborhood is, exactly. One thing that\textquoteright { } s pretty clear is that what\textquoteright { } s right about the aphorism, that there\textquoteright { } s no disputing about taste, isn\textquoteright { } t that there\textquoteright { } s no disputing about taste. There\textquoteright { } s heaps of disputing about taste. People engage in disputes about which movies, music, paintings, literature, meals, furniture, architectural styles, etc. are good, beautiful, tasty, fun, elegant, ugly, disgusting, etc. all the time. This is obvious to anyone who has watched dueling-movie-critics shows, read theater reviews, or negotiated with a group or partner about which movie or restaurant to go to, or which sofa or painting to put in the living room. It takes great care and good aim to fling a brick without hitting somebody who\textquoteright { } s engaged in a dispute about taste."

  Title: Epistemic Modals, Relativism and Assertion
  Author: Andy Egan
  Journal: Philosophical Studies
  Year: 2007
  Number: 1
  Pages: 1--22
  Volume: 133
  Abstract: "I think that there are good reasons to adopt a relativist semantics for epistemic modal claims such as ``the treasure might be under the palm tree, according to which such utterances determine a truth value relative to something finer-grained than just a world or a $<$world, time$>$ pair . Anyone who is inclined to relativise truth to more than just worlds and times faces a problem about assertion. It s easy to be puzzled about just what purpose would be served by assertions of this kind, and how to understand what we d be up to in our use of sentences like ``the treasure might be under the palm tree, if they have such peculiar truth conditions. After providing a very quick argument to motivate a relativist view of epistemic modals, I bring out and attempt to resolve this problem in making sense of the role of assertions with relativist truth conditions. Solving this problem should be helpful in two ways: first, it eliminates an apparently forceful objection to relativism, and second, spelling out the relativist account of assertion and communication will help to make clear just what the relativist position is, exactly, and why it s interesting."

  Title: Epistemic Modals in Context
  Author: Andy Egan and John Hawthorne and Brian Weatherson
  BookTitle: Contextualism in Philosophy
  Type: chapter
  Publisher: Oxford University Press
  Year: 2005
  Pages: 131--170
  Abstract: "A very simple contextualist treatment of a sentence containing an epistemic modal, e.g. a might be F, is that it is true iff for all the contextually salient community knows, a is F. It is widely agreed that the simple theory will not work in some cases, but the counterexamples produced so far seem amenable to a more complicated contextualist theory. We argue, however, that no contextualist theory can capture the evaluations speakers naturally make of sentences containing epistemic modals. If we want to respect these evaluations, our best option is a relativist theory of epistemic modals. On a relativist theory, an utterance of a might be F can be true relative to one context of evaluation and false relative to another. We argue that such a theory does better than any rival approach at capturing all the behaviour of epistemic modals."

  Title: Context and the Composition of Meaning
  Author: Jan van Eijck
  Year: n/a
  Abstract: "Key ingredients in discourse meaning are reference markers: objects in the formal representation that the discourse is about. It is well-known that reference markers are not like { } rst order variables. Indeed, it is the received view that reference markers are like the variables in imperative programming languages. However, in a computational semantics of discourse that treats reference markers as \textquoteleft { } dynamically bound\textquoteright variables, every noun phrase will get linked to a dynamic variable, so it will give rise to a marker index. Where do these indices come from? How do we handle them when combining or \textquoteleft { } merging\textquoteright pieces of discourse? We will argue that reference markers are better treated as indices into context, and we will present a theory of context and context extension based on this view. In context semantics, noun phrases do not come with { } xed indices, so the merge problem does not arise. This solves a vexing issue with coordination that causes trouble for all current versions of compositional discourse representation theory."

  Title: Presuppositions and Anaphors in Attitude Contexts
  Author: Bart Geurts
  Journal: Linguistics and Philosophy
  Type: article
  Year: 1998
  Number: 6
  Pages: 545--601
  Volume: 21
  Abstract: "This paper consists of two main parts and a coda. In the first part I present the binding theory of presupposition projection, which is the framework that I adopt in this paper Section 1.1 . I outline the main problems that arise in the interplay between presuppositions and anaphors on the one hand and attitude reports on the other Section 1.2, and discuss Heim s theory of presuppositions in attitude contexts Section 1.3 .In the second part of the paper I present my own proposal. To begin with, I define an extension of DRT in which attitude reports can be represented Sections 2.1-{ } 2.2 . I then argue that the verb believe triggers a certain presupposition and that, given the binding theory, this presupposition determines the projection behaviour of the verb Section 2.3 . This analysis yields predictions which are incomplete in the sense that they do not fully account for speakers intuitions about presuppositions and anaphors in belief contexts. In Section 2.4 I suggest that this is as it should be because we may assume on independent grounds that there is a class of plausibility inferences which complement the predictions of the presupposition theory. Finally, the analysis is extended to the verb want Section 2.5."

  Abstract: "The information conveyed by any utterance is a motley ensemble. Utterances carry content about the world as it is according to the speaker, but also about speakers\textquoteright attitudes, the way they speak, what has been said before, and so on. There are many kinds of information that are conveyed by way of language, and di { } erences in kind correlate with di { } erences in status. Presupposed information exhibits a distinctive projection behaviour; conversational implicatures are cancellable in a way that asserted information is not; a pronoun\textquoteright { } s gender may help to determine a referent, but is otherwise truth-conditionally inert; and so on."

  Title: Dynamic Predicate Logic
  Author: Jeroen Groenendijk and Martin Stokhof
  Journal: Linguistics and Philosophy
  Year: 1991
  Type: article
  Number: 1
  Pages: 39--100
  Volume: 14
  Abstract: "This paper is devoted to the formulation and investigation of a dynamic semantic interpretation of the language of { } rst-order predicate logic. The resulting system, which will be referred to as \textquoteleft { } dynamic predicate logic\textquoteright, is intended as a { } rst step towards a compositional, non-representational theory of discourse semantics. In the last decade, various theories of discourse semantics have emerged within the paradigm of model-theoretic semantics. A common feature of these theories is a tendency to do away with the principle of compositionality, a principle which, implicitly or explicitly, has dominated semantics since the days of Frege. Therefore the question naturally arises whether non-compositionality is in any way a necessary feature of discourse semantics. Since we subscribe to the interpretation of compositionality as constituting primarily a methodological principle, we consider this to be a methodological rather than an empirical question. As a consequence, the emphasis in the present paper lies on developing an alternative compositional semantics of discourse, which is empirically equivalent to its non-compositional brethren, but which di { } ers from them in a principled methodological way. Hence, no attempts are made to improve on existing theories empirically. Nevertheless, as we indicate in section 5, the development of a compositional alternative may in the end have empirical consequences, too. First of all, it can be argued that the dynamic view on interpretation developed in this paper suggests natural and relatively easy to formulate extensions which enable one to deal with a wider range of phenomena than can be dealt with in existing theories. Moreover, the various approaches to the model-theoretic semantics of discourse that have been developed during the last decade, have constituted a \textquoteleft { } fresh start\textquoteright in the sense that much of what had been accomplished before was ignored, at least for a start. Of course, this is a justi { } ed strategy if one feels one is trying to develop a radically di { } erent approach to recalcitrant problems. However, there comes a time when such new approaches have to be compared with the older one, and when an assessment of the pros and cons of each has to be made. One of the main problems in semantics today, we feel, is that a semantic theory such as Montague grammar, and an approach like Kamp\textquoteright { } s discourse representation theory, are hard to compare, let alone that it is possible to unify their insights and results."

  Department: ILLC/Department of Philosophy
  Affiliation: University of Amsterdam
  Abstract: "The paper sketches the place of dynamic semantics within a broader picture of developments in philosophical and linguistic theories of mean-ing. Some basic concepts of dynamic semantics are illustrated by means of a detailed analysis of anaphoric deﬁnite and indeﬁnite descrip-tions, which are treated as contextually dependent quantiﬁcational ex-pressions. It is shown how a dynamic view sheds new light on the contextual nature of interpretation, on the diﬀerence between mono-logue and dialogue, and on the interplay between direct and indirect information."

  Author: Barbara J. Grosz and Aravind K. Joshi and Scott Weinstein
  Department: Institute for Reseach in Cognitive Science
  Affiliation: University of Pennsylvania
  Year: 1995
  Abstract: "This paper concerns relationships among focus of attention, choice of referring expression, and perceived coherence of utterances within a discourse segment. It presents a framework and initial theory of centering which are intended to model the local component of attentional state. The paper examines interactions between local coherence and choice of referring expressions; it argues that differences in coherence correspond in part to the inference demands made by different types of referring expressions given a particular attentional state. It demonstrats that the attentional state properties modelled by centering can account fo these differences."

  Title: "Lumps of Thought: A Reply"
  Author: Angelika Kratzer
  Year: n/a
  Abstract: "Both Kratzer 1981 \textquotedblleft { } Partition and Revision\textquotedblright and Kratzer 1989 \textquotedblleft { } Lumps of Thought\textquotedblright assume that the truth of counterfactuals depends on a parameter. The parameter provides a set of propositions that uniquely characterizes the actual world in Kratzer 1981, and a so-called \textquotedblleft { } set of propositions relevant for the truth of counterfactuals\textquotedblright in Kratzer 1989. Both papers try to find empirical constraints for the relevant sets, but crucially without characterizing them uniquely. The vagueness and context-dependency of counterfactuals is assumed to be in part due to the fact that the set of propositions that the truth of counterfactuals depends on is underdetermined."

  Title: Situations in Natural Language Semantics
  Author: Angelika Kratzer
  BookTitle: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
  Type: chapter
  Year: 2008
  Abstract: "Situation semantics was developed as an alternative to possible worlds semantics. In situation semantics, linguistic expressions are evaluated with respect to partial, rather than complete, worlds. There is no consensus about what situations are, just as there is no consensus about what possible worlds or events are. According to some, situations are structured entities consisting of relations and individuals standing in those relations. According to others, situations are particulars. In spite of unresolved foundational issues, the partiality provided by situation semantics has led to some genuinely new approaches to a variety of phenomena in natural language semantics. In the way of illustration, this article includes relatively detailed overviews of a few selected areas where situation semantics has been successful: implicit quantifier domain restrictions, donkey pronouns, and exhaustive interpretations. It moreover addresses the question of how Davidsonian event semantics can be embedded in a semantics based on situations. Other areas where a situation semantics perspective has led to progress include attitude ascriptions, questions, tense, aspect, nominalizations, implicit arguments, point of view, counterfactual conditionals, and discourse relations."

  Author: Angelika Kratzer
  Journal: Theoretical Linguistics
  Type: article
  Year: 2004
  Pages: 123--136
  Volume: 30
  Abstract: "The BPR assumes that we already know how sentences are partitioned into focused and backgrounded material, and this is quite legitimate, given the literature on the topic see e.g. Krifka 1991, von Stechow 1991 . If the BPR was true, no more would have to be said about the meaning of focus. The behavior of whatever inferences are generated by backgrounding could be taken care of by theories dealing with the projection of presuppositions of the familiar kind, the presuppositions of definite descriptions, clefts, or factives, for example. This is a non-trivial and interesting claim."

  Number: 3
  Pages: 337--355
  Volume: 1
  Abstract: "In this paper I offer an account of the meaning of must and can within the framework of possible worlds semantics. The paper consists of two parts: the first argues for a relative concept of modality underlying modal words like must and can in natural language. I give preliminary definitions of the meaning of these words which are formulated in terms of logical consequence and compatibility, respectively. The second part discusses one kind of insufficiency in the meaning definitions given in the first part, which arise from the ex falso quodlibet paradox of logical consequence. In stepwise fashion, I make an attempt to avoid most of the consequences of this paradox for the meaning definitions of must and can."

  Title: The Semantics and Pragmatics of Presupposition
  Author: Alex Lascarides
  Year: n/a
  Abstract: "In this paper, we offer a novel analysis of presuppositions, paying particular attention to the interaction between the knowledge resources that are required to interpret them. The analysis has two main features. First, we capture an analogy between presuppositions, anaphora and scope ambiguity cf. van der Sandt, 1992, by utilising semantic underspecification cf. Reyle, 1993 . Second, resolving this underspecification requires reasoning about how the presupposition is rhetorically connected to the discourse context. This has several consequences. First, since pragmatic information plays a role in computing the rhetorical relation, it also constrains the interpretation of presuppositions. Our account therefore goes beyond existing ones, and provides a forum for analysing problematic data, that require pragmatic reasoning. Second, binding presuppositions to the context via rhetorical links replaces accommodating them, in the sense of adding them to the context cf. Lewis, 1979 . Thus, unlike previous theories, we don t resort to interpretation mechanisms that are peculiar to presuppositions. Rather, they are handled entirely in terms of the discourse update procedure. We formalise this approach in SDRT Asher 1993, Lascarides and Asher 1993, and demonstrate that it provides a rich framework for interpreting presuppositions, where semantic and pragmatic constraints are integrated."

  Volume: 15

  DOI: 10.1007/s11050-007-9022-y
  Abstract: "Imperatives may be interpreted with many subvarieties of directive force, for example as orders, invitations, or pieces of advice. I argue that the range of meanings that imperatives can convey should be identiﬁed with the variety of interpretations that are possible for non-dynamic root modals (what I call ‘priority modals’), including deontic, bouletic, and teleological readings. This paper presents an analysis of the relationship between imperatives and priority modals in discourse which asserts that, just as declaratives contribute to the Common Ground and thus provide information relevant to the interpre-tation of epistemic modals in subsequent discourse, imperatives contribute to another component of the discourse context, the addressee’s To-Do List, which serves as a contextual resource for the interpretation of priority modals. This analysis predicts that the interpretation of imperatives and modals in discourse is constrained in surprising ways; these predictions are borne out."

  Title: Plurals, Presuppositions, and the Sources of Distributivity
  Author: Roger Schwarzschild
  Journal: Natural Language Semantics
  Type: article
  Year: 1994
  Volume: 2
  Pages: 201-248
  Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers
  Abstract: "This paper begins with a discussion of CUMULATIVITY (e.g., 'P(a) & P(b) implies P(a+b)'), formalized using a verb phrase operator. Next, the meanings of distribu- tivity markers such as each and non-distributivity indicators such as together are considered. An existing analysis of each in terms of quantification over parts of a plurality is adopted. However, together is problematic, for it involves a cancellation or negation of the quantification associated with each. (The four boys together owned exactly three cars could not be true if each of the boys owned three cars, though the same sentence without together could be.) A refinement of this idea of negated quantification over parts is proposed as an analysis for non-distributivity operators. It is then worked out in the system described in Cooper (1983), in which positive and negative extensions are assigned. Presuppositions connected with plural refer- ence are considered at this point as well. Finally, the cumulativity operator is argued to be quantificational and therefore sensitive to contextual domain selection. This context sensitivity is claimed to be the source of distributive readings that appear in the absence of modifiers like each and non-distributive or collective readings that arise without together."

  Journal: Journal of Logic, Language and Information
  Type: article
  Year: 2003
  Number: 3
  Pages: 351--368
  Volume: 12
  Abstract: "There are three ways to refer to a fact from the complement of afactive verb: 1 Via abstract object anaphoric reference, or, witha full sentential complement that will be interpreted either 2 asa bound presupposition or 3 as triggering a presupposition of afact that will have to be accommodated. Spoken corpus examplesreveal that these three possibilities differ in relation to thetype of information they tend to contribute, and this has twoeffects. First, the information status of the fact and its role inthe discourse seem to affect the preference for one constructionover another in a particular context. Second, presupposed factivecomplements that need to be accommodated tend to be hearer-new andthe focus of the utterance, meaning that information structureseems to contribute to the felicity of accommodation ofpresupposed facts."

  Year: 2009
  Pages: 1707--26
  Volume: 41
  Abstract: "We argue that contrastive statements have the same underlying semantics and affect the context in the same way as denials. We substantiate this claim by giving a unified account of the two phenomena that treats contrast as a subtype of denial. This analysis crucially requires a dynamic semantics view of context-dependence with a multi-dimensional representation of information."

  Title: On the Representation of Context
  Author: Robert Stalnaker
  Journal: Journal of Logic, Language and Information
  Type: article
  Year: 1998
  Number: 1
  Pages: 3--19
  Volume: 7
  Abstract: "This paper revisits some foundational questions concerning the abstract representation of a discourse context. The context of a conversation is represented by a body of information that is presumed to be shared by the participants in the conversation -the information that the speaker presupposes a point at which a speech act is interpreted. This notion is designed to represent both the information on which context-dependent speech acts depend, and the situation that speech acts are designed to affect, and so to be a representation of context that is appropriate for explaining the interaction of context and the contents expressed in them. After reviewing the motivating ideas and the outlines of the apparatus, the paper responds to a criticism of the framework, and considers the way it can help to clarify some phenomena concerning pronouns with indefinite antecedents."

  Title: "Enlightened Update: A Computational Architecture for Presupposition and Other Pragmatic Phenomena"
  Author: Richmond H. Thomason and Matthew Stone
  Year: n/a
  Abstract: "We relate the theory of presupposition accommodation to a computational framework for reasoning in conversation. We understand presuppositions as private commitments the speaker makes in using an utterance but expects the listener to recognize based on mutual information. On this understanding, the conversation can move forward not just through the positive effects of interlocutors\textquoteright utterances but also from the retrospective insight interlocutors gain about one anothers\textquoteright mental states from observing what they do. Our title, ENLIGHTENED UPDATE, highlights such cases. Our approach fleshes out two key principles: that interpretation is a form of intention recognition; and that intentions are complex informational structures, which specify commitments to conditions and to outcomes as well as to actions. We present a formalization and implementation of these principles for a simple conversational agent, and draw on this case study to argue that pragmatic reasoning is holistic in character, continuous with common-sense reasoning about collaborative activities, and most effectively characterized by associating specific, reliable interpretive constraints directly with grammatical forms. In showing how to make such claims precise and to develop theories that respect them, we illustrate the general place of computation in the cognitive science of language."
