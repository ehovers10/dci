# Introduction

cooperative principle:
  "Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged."

collaborative principle:
  "Make your conversational effort such that, together with your interlocutors' efforts, it advances the inquiry along the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you all are engaged."

# Knowledge in the image of inquiry

levi identity:
  "Conceived semantically, all rational information state revision is reducible to some combination of set intersection and union among information states and propositions."

jamesian amendment:
  "Rational information state revision is governed by two goals: avoiding error and acquiring truth."

# Collaborative discourse dynamics

constraints on a theory of meaning:
  charity:
    "The attitudes determined by the system are more or less the beliefs and desires we would have were we to be in the speaker's position, broadly construed."
  rationalization:
    "The system supplies beliefs and desires that generally represent the speaker as having good reason for performing the actions he performs."
  truthfulness:
    "The system assigns meanings that accord with the speaker participating in a convention of truthfulness with other speakers of his language."
  generativity:
    "The complete system of meanings is at least finitely specifiable, and perhaps also reasonably uniform and simple."
  manifestation:
    "The beliefs and desires that the system maintains are held by the speaker are revealed in his dispositions to speech behavior."
  triangulation:
    "The system provides meanings that link the specifications of the speaker's beliefs and desires in both their language and the theorizer's."

# Dispute in discourse

# Observations

obs:
  refinement:
    "The [Bears](#bears) dialogue is *coherent*, exhibiting a relation of *refinement* between the first and second utternace."

  correction:
    "The completion phase of the [Bears](#bears) discourse serves to correct the initiation phase, a *correctible* utterance."

  resiliance:
    "The [Bears](#bears) initiation is *resiliant*. In certain contexts, it is appropriate for the utterer of a correctible to refrain from retracting it in the face of a challenge."

  productivity:
    "The [Bears](#bears) completion is *productive*. It does not merely refer back to the initiation but extends the discourse in a distinctive way."

  susceptibility:
    "The [Bears](#bears) initiation is susceptible to challenge. In certain contexts, it is appropriate for an initiator's interlocutors to challenge their attempted contribution."
