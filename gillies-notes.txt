Definition 4.3 (order). R is orderly iff:
     i. R(Di ∩ P , P )
    ii. R(Di ∩ P , Q) and Q ⊆ S imply R(Di ∩ P , S)
   iii. R(Di ∩ P , Q) and R(Di ∩ P , S) imply R(Di ∩ P , Q ∩ S)
R is something (if ·)(·) at i could mean only if it is orderly.

Definition 4.5 (quality). R is qualitative iff:
       R(Di ∩ P , Q) implies R(π (Di ∩ P ), π (Q))
R is something (if ·)(·) at i could mean only if it is qualitative.

Observation 4.1. Assume R is a conditional relation properly so called. Then
R(Di ∩ P , Q) iff Di ∩ P ⊆ Q.
Proof. I care about the left-to-right direction.
    Suppose — for reductio — that R(Di ∩ P , Q) but Di ∩ P ⊆ Q. What we’ll
see is: (i) R(Di ∩ P , P ∩ Q); (ii) the world that witnesses that Di ∩ P ⊆ Q can
be exploited (by quality) to show that no world in P ∩ Q plays a role in
R(Di ∩ P , P ∩ Q) holding — from which it follows that R(Di ∩ P , ); (iii) from
which it follows that Di ∩ P must be empty — a contradiction.
    (i): By hypothesis R(Di ∩ P , Q). By order it follows that R(Di ∩ P , P ) and
hence that R(Di ∩ P , P ∩ Q).
    (iia): Claim: Di ∩ P ∩ Q = . Proof of Claim: Assume otherwise. order
guarantees that R(Di ∩ P , Di ∩ P ). By hypothesis R(Di ∩ P , Q), and so by
order R(Di ∩ P , Di ∩ P ∩ Q). Applying the assumption that Di ∩ P ∩ Q = :
R(Di ∩ P , ). Appeal to order again and we have that R(Di ∩ P , S) for any
S. But then Di ∩ P must be empty (activity), contradicting the assumption
that Di ∩ P Q and proving the Claim.
    (iib): Let j be a witness to Di ∩ P ⊆ Q. So j ∈ Di ∩ P but j ∈ Q. Now pick
any confirming instance k — that is, any k ∈ Di ∩ P ∩ Q — and let π be the
mapping that swaps k and j and leaves all else untouched:
      • π (j) = k
      • π (k) = j
      • π (i) = i for every i ∈ j, k
By (i) R(Di ∩ P , P ∩ Q). Hence, by quality, R(π (Di ∩ P ), π (P ∩ Q)). But π
doesn’t affect Di ∩ P . So: R(Di ∩ P , π (P ∩ Q)). That is: R holds between
Di ∩ P and both P ∩ Q and π (P ∩ Q). Hence — by order — it holds also
between Di ∩ P and their intersection: R(Di ∩ P , (P ∩ Q) ∩ π (P ∩ Q)). But
π (P ∩ Q) = ((P ∩ Q) \ {k}) ∪ j , so their intersection is (P ∩ Q) \ {k}. So:
R(Di ∩P , (P ∩Q)\{k}). Which is to say that k is irrelevant for R’s holding. But
k was any world in Di ∩ P ∩ Q, so finiteness plus order implies R(Di ∩ P , ).
    (iii): Appeal to order again: since R(Di ∩ P , ), it holds that for any S
whatever R(Di ∩ P , S). Whence, by activity, it follows that Di ∩ P = . And
that contradicts the assumption that Di ∩ P ⊆ Q.
