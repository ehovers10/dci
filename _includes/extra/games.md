### Games, players, and strategies

One way to specify the nature of a game is to sit down before any play takes place and outline in a legislative (*prescriptive*) fashion the necessary tools for engaging in the game and restrictions on behavior for proper engagement. An alternative game-maker strategy is to record the game as it is played, and attempt to write down, in a *descriptive* fashion, generalizations about the specific behaviors we record.

Whatever process we use, we arrive at a set of regularities by which players (are meant to) abide in game play -- a set we call the *rules* of the game.[^constitutive] A *rulebook* for the game is a consolidation of those reglarities into a robust and simple list. Both game-making strategies allow for divergences between the rulebook and actual game play: players may disobey a prescriptive rulebook, and the simplicity achieved by consolidating regularities of behavior in the descriptive strategy may gloss over anomalous bumps in actual game play.

The games that are of interest to us -- baseball and a language game -- require a descriptive strategy. The players in these games understand the games they play, which is to say that they possess an internal rulebook. But in neither game does the rulebook match any pre-established legislative text. In the case of language, there never has been a rulebook laid out. Myriad style guides exist, and some of them take on the qualities of prescritive texts. But despite their strictures, the game is played the way it is played; it is an interesting question of what it is that the players have internalized.

The case of baseball is different, but not very much so. The game started as an offshoot of similar bat oriented games, was developed by the individuals who gathered to play. Eventually, interested spectators began to record the players' movings about and codified a simple rule book. Future players conformed their play to the interpretation of these rule books they found pleasing, and the process iterated a few times. Eventually, interest in the game took off, and governing bodies were formed. As governing bodies do, they laid down more rigid legislation as the rule book, and game play began to more consistently conform to those regulations. But even today, game play departs in sometimes significant ways from what is laid down in the rule book. One salient departure is the way that pitches are determined to be balls or strikes. So, those who are interested in the game of baseball have reason to study the movements of players in the game and ask what it is that they have internalized as the rules of the game.

So, we will focus on descriptive accounts of these games, treating them as physical systems for which we attempt to provide a theory. But games are a different sort of system; they are *teleological* in the sense that they have *players* who are engaged in an attempt to achieve some *goal* of the game. In addition, characterizing descriptions of interesting games, like the two that concern us, are *reflexive* and *incomplete*.[^gametheory]

#### Reflexivity

A game is reflexive when a characterization of the evolution of game play makes essential reference to the behavior of the players. This is an interesting feature of certain games, because, in addition to being theoretical objects in the game's rulebook, its players are also *agents* in game play. Their internal rulebooks provide them with an understanding of the game and they apply that understanding through the course of the game by using the rulebook to both understand the current game context and to decide on their next action. In generalizing over they behavior, we thus implicitly build elements of the rulebook into itself.

Not all games are reflexive in this sense. Lottery games are a good example. A lottery has players (ticket holders) engaged in an attempt to achieve some goal (the jackpot). As such, it is a game. But while reference to the players may be necessary to specify the initial conditions of the game (perhaps the selection method is determined in part by the number of ticket holders), no essential reference to them is needed to specify the way in which the outcome is achieved. The selection method is not itself a player in the game.

But many games are reflexive, and both baseball and a language game are. It is not possible to provide a complete and accurate characterization of the evolution of one of these games from initial conditions to final outcome without referencing the behavior of the players in the game.

#### Indeterminate

A description of a game is determinate if it specifies, for each player and each possible game context, a unique appropriate move for that player in that context. Determinacy is akin to the existence of a strong solution to a game in the game theory sense.

Games can fail to be determinate in a couple of different ways. They may be essentially indeterminate, which is to say that there is no specification that is both accurate and complete. There are gaps in strategy. Or it may be practically indeterminate, in that there is no specification meeting the demands of the theorizing agent that is both accurate and complete.

The game of tic-tac-toe is both practically and essentially determinate. Chess is essentially determinate, but practically indeterminate. Baseball and natural language are, arguably, essentially incomplete. They involve a level of complexity, manifested in the inexhaustible variations in degree of skill that players can exhibit in the course of the game, that there is no way of specifying at the outset of a game the unique best strategy to engage in during the course of the game.

Call a game whose description is both reflexive and incomplete *living*. Strategic games are subject to a interesting phenomenon. Since players are agents in the game, and they have no determinate course of action while playing the game, each interation of the game will be slightly different from the last. Since descriptive accounts of games attempt to capture regularities of the game as it is actually played, each iteration of game play updates the rulebook slightly. Over time, the descriptive system can evolve rather substantially.[^reflexive]

### Metrics

Every individual game is associated with a *score* that records the game situation at any point along its evolution. Different player behavior serves to update the score in various ways. Allowable behaviors receive some sort of recourse to game score change, but not all behaviors evolve the game toward its end state to the same degree.

Call a *metric* any generalization of player behavior within a game that characterizes some component of the behavior's value in changing the score of the game.

Standard metrics in baseball include batting average, steals, runs batted in, strikeouts, home runs allowed, and earned run average. These metrics categorize and aggregate various player behavior with an eye toward providing an accurate representation of the impact the player has on changing the score of this (or future) games of which they are a part.
Metrics categorize behavior, but to the extent that they can be assigned to players that exhibit that behavior, they represent dispositions to change the score.

Relatively recent study into the evolution of game play in baseball has suggested that these standard metrics fail to measure player impact on the score, either because variations in the chosen metric do not correlate strongly with changes in game score or, while they do so the changes are not appropriately attributed to the player whose behavior is being aggregated.

This research offers alternatives to the standard metrics -- new metrics that go by the names of wins abover replacement, fielding independent pitching, ultimate zone rating, and deserved run average. Despite the empirical and conceptual backing these advanced metrics acrue, and despite the slow trickle of of evidence that an increased emphasis on these metrics in designing a team correlates with increased team wins, there are a large number of detractors, and they are very vocal about the inadequacy of these metrics. Many of the detractors are current or former baseball players.

I would like to offer a diagnosis of the detractors' animosity to the advanced stats. It is not that the stats fail to characterize genuine trends in the game (true generalizations). Nor, as some have suggested, that they see the stats as a threat to their interests, either financially or in terms of fame.

Baseball is a game that can be enjoyed from two perspectives. A third-party spectator can enjoy the performance of others within the game, and players can enjoy the game differently in virtue of their distinctive, first-personal perspective on it.

It is that they fail to understand the stats. But this is not a failure of intellectual power. It is a prespectival mis-alignment. The stats fail to speak to them as characters in the game. The traditional stats at least appear to give them actionable directives, while the advanced stats provide no sense of how they could make use of them to improve their performance in the game.

Some athletes are finding ways, but the requisite shift in perspective points to an important feature of characterizing games. They have rules that allow for better and worse play. And the generalizations are not intended just for interested third parties, but also for those that have a hand in shaping the data used in the generalization.

The situations is similar, but different, for linguistic theorizing. For the game is not so much about playing better or worse --  there is no winning at the language game. But it is a theoretical system where those studying the game have a hand in the data available. In some sense, they know the rules.

This sets theorizing about intentional systems apart from other theorizing (though perhaps not so far apart, cf. collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics).

+ Positional strength
    + Likelihood of achieving positive valence end-state given the proposition
    + For solved games, this reduces to 0 or 1
    + For determinate games, it can be given fractional scores in terms of proportions of uneliminated end states that have positive valence.
    + For indeterminate games, either practically or essentially, it can still be a useful notion, for it serves to direct the strategy of players.
+ Metrics
    + Chess piece strength, WAR, RBI
    + Positionally (contextually) defined
    + Player relative
    + In indeterminate games, they are theoretical posits, developed by intuition and statisitical analysis
    + Extrinsic: It is a way of organizing game context information to direct further game play.
    + Types, based on generalizability
        + Basic: records specific contextual information and spits out a value
        + Positional: Generalizes over game to give strength of the class of positions
        + Player: generalizes over game and context to give value of that player
    + Perspectival: patterns are value system relative.
        + GM is akin to the chess player
        + Baseball player is akin to the chess piece
        + Some metrics lend themselves to easier generalizations (positional, player) and this have different applicability.
    + Strategic plans: incomplete restrictions of open moves.
    + Factors in the starting position
    + Built by the game rules
    + May be sensative to external factors
        + Past score changes within the game: such metrics are *coherent*, whereas *independent* metrics do not depend on the path the game has taken in reaching the current position.
        + Player skill
        + General position within the game: opening, midgame, endgame.
+ Strategy: process for choosing a move in any given game position (Shannon)

Scoreboards record all positional data relevant to game evolution. Metrics consolidate this information to provide a measure of positional strength in terms of achievement of a particular end state, relativized to a coalition of interest.

Scoreboards do not record every game relevant event. They don't for instance, record the seach ply level for chess players or the closing speed and route accuracy of an outfielder tracking down a fly.

Scoreboards only record events that advance the game toward its end state. Thus, a large class of actions within a game will be in the same cell of a state space partition defermined by the scoreboard structure and values the pegs can take.

Since score changes are determined in part by the nature of the end state, we can think of such changes as associated with a value: namely, a measure of the significance of that change in bringing about the end state. In competitive games, this value will be player relative.

We can think of two perspectives on change value:

+ Overall significance: a measure of how large of a change such a move is relative to all possible changes.
+ Proportional significance: a measure of how far along the path to victory (defeat) the move takes the game relative to its current position.

Proportional significnace presupposes that we can assign a positional strength value to a scoreboard state. This value, which we call the *score*, tells us how likely each player is to bring about one of their preferred end states. *Likelihood* is to be understood in a pre-theoretic sense. For certain games, we can give it a relative frequency interpretation, where likelihood of victory is simply the proportion of possible game evolutions from the current state that have the preferred state as endpoint. But for other games, because the state space is, while finite, unknown, or because the space of moves (whether score changing or not) is essentially innumerable, likelihood has a more conceptual character. It may be based on the experience of game experts or on analysis of a sample of particular games.

The state-based valuation is derivative on the score-change valuation, which is itself determined by scoreboard changing moves. Thus, value is calculable from the particular score change. Call and algorithm that attempts to performs this calculation a *metric*. Metrics are patterns within the fabric composed of scores associated with a complete game.

### Quiessence

Because of the highly interleaved nature of games, and because many options are available to each player (which is what makes games *playable*) metrics carry with them an implicit restrcition of moves. In game solution theory, this is an assumption of *perfect play*. We judge the likelihood of, say, black reaching her preferred end state assuming that all play from the current position, for both white and black, is perfect (correct). [An extra level of complexity is built in when perfect play is ill-defined.] The perfect-play restriction thus builds player skill and player acknowledgement of the score directly into the scoreboard. It is *recurrsive*, and the player is an essential element of the game characterization.

Evaluations are only applied in *quiescent* positions, as opposed to, say, mid-queen exchanges. In a game replete with collaborative exchanges, there will be many moves that must reference other moves and, thus, other scores before a static point is reached. Strategies are developed within a sandbox, testing out the various options until a static point is reached. Once all options have been tried, the best result is merged into the main state. In a competitive game, sandboxing is performed solo, in a hypothetical way. In a cooperative game, the process is performed in the conversation, but backgrounded.

Collaboration demands that evaluations be integrated into the score. Score is self-referential. Usability is not just a heurisitic, it is score determining.

The rules tell you how to play the game. Evaluations tell you how to play it *well*. Actually, they tell you only where you stand in the game. And what it tells you assumes perfect play going forward. To use the function to inform your play, you must attempt to move into positions that have high value. The evaluation function is intended to be used to inform play, but the function is built apon an assumption of perfect play. Perfect play is itself understood in terms of maximization of post-move positional evaluation. Thus, evaluations functions are circularly grounded.

+ Chess eval. fxn takes [material,mobility,development,perfect play] and outputs value. Value is used to determine perfect play
+ Baseball WAR takes [runs,walks,strike outs, etc, replacement level] and outputs value. Value is used to determine replacement level

These metrics are not grounded, but they can be *callibrated*. Callibration is a statistical measure based on similar game positions.

There are score changes that are not associated with metrical changes. Metric evaluations cover strings of score changes. Score is of finer granularity than the metric, in two senses:

+ Partiality: metrics *cull* only specific elements of the score
+ Collaboration: metrics evaluate strings of score changes

This differences in granularity is not just a practical matter of limited resources to dedicate to evaluation. Moves are genuinely interlaced, which demands a collaborative approach to evaluation.
