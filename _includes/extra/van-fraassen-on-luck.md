Peirce well recognized this fact, granting that inference from cases is merely probabilified deduction in ordinary situations and without justification the foundational ones.

> The relative probability of this or that arrangement of Nature is something which we should have a right to talk about if universes were as plenty as blackberries, if we could put a quantity of them in a bag, shake them up well, draw out a sample, and examine them to see what proportion of them had one arrangement and what proportion another. But, even in that case, a higher universe would contain us, in regard to whose arrangements the conception of probability could have no applicability.

> We have examined the problem proposed by the conceptualists, which, translated into clear language, is this: Given a synthetic conclusion; required to know out of all the possible states of things how many will accord, to any assigned extent, with this conclusion; and we have found that it is only an absurd attempt to reduce synthetic to analytic reason, and that no definite solution is possible. {% include appendices/ref.html id="peirce1877a" p="184-5" %}

Of course, Peirce still felt that there was a logic of ampliative inference, that it was essentially statistical, and that it could be epistemically grounded by *self-correction*:

> Induction is the experimental testing of a theory. The justification of it is that, although the conclusion at any stage of the investigation may be more or less erroneous, yet the further application of the same method must correct the error. (5.145)

Others have been much less sanguine about the prospects of characterizing such an ampliative, yet *secure* mode of reasoning.

Bas van Fraassen {% include appendices/ref.html id="vanfraassen2000" e="," %} accepting that an epistemology based on the search for a secure, ampliative inference is bound to come up empty, proposes an alternative conception of the pursuit of science:

> Given that traditional epistemology embodies false hopes never to be satisfied, we must try to find a different view of our epistemic condition, with new hopes and new dreams of its own. So here is our tragic protagonist, thrown into a world she never made, and she asks us: What does it take?
>
> We answer her: it takes luck, courage, and technique; but the greatest of these is luck. {% include appendices/ref.html id="vanfraassen2000" e="," p="273" %}

Foregoing the blind scramble for security and succumbing to the necessity of luck is not, however, a submission to skepticism, for luck has a tendency to open its arms and soften our fall.

> If our pursuit of knowledge, however broadly or feebly construed, is to be successful, we must be lucky -- we have no way to constrain such fortune. This is the verdict on modern philosophy's misguided search for security. The history of Earth has seen great disasters that spelled the extinction of almost all life, including the dominant, best adapted among species. In each case, some forms of life happened to be suited to the radically and suddenly transformed circumstances -- thus evolution on Earth continued after all. See who was lucky and who was not! Look to those survivors, they weave not; neither do they spin; but fortune smiles on them. {% include appendices/ref.html id="vanfraassen2000" e="," p="273" %}
