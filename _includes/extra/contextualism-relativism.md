## Meaning and context

Utterance meaning is sensitive to context, but who determines the context appropriate to evaluating an utterance? There is pressure to say that the speaker controls the meaning of her words. After all, Grice taught us that speaker meaning is intentional. The speaker is most intimately connected to what she has said, and must retain some right to determining what she meant by what she said.

But Humpty Dumpty took things too far.

> 'When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, 'it means just what I choose it to mean â€” neither more nor less.'

Convention determines the meaning of the words one utters, though context can be influential in determining what word it is that is uttered.

But there is also pressure from the other side to say that utterance interpretation is relative. It is a common contention that words can mean different things to different people.

There is a source of linguistic evidence that promises to break this stalemate.

**The argument from disagreement**

1. Intuitions about genuine disagreement are pertinent to theorizing about linguistic content.

    + In this sense, facts about genuine disagreement are similar to facts about truth conditions and anaphora resolution.

2. Genuine disagreement requires shared content on which the disputing parties take conflicting stances.

    + A principal feature of content is that it is truth-conditional. In so far as uttering a sentence in context commits one to a belief in its content, one form of disagreement is realized when two parties are committed to conflicting beliefs with a single proposition as their base content. For instance, one individual believes *A* and another believes its negation *&not;A*.

3. Relativism posits a *context neutral* content.

    + There is a single content that is expressed in both party's speech or thought. Each party assigns to that content a different truth value; thus, the disagreement. But such contents are complex objects, and the conflicting assignments can each be accurate for the part to which they pertain; thus the sense that each party exerts a right in their assignment.

4. Contextualism issues in context specific contents.

    + Such contents build contextual features into them. Assignment of conflicting truth values to the same sentence amounts to assignment of truth values to distinct propositions. Each party can be correct in the assignment they make, but the sense of genuine disagreement is lost.

The argument from disagreement is a schema that can be applied to specific questions regarding the nature of content as a means of helping to dscide between competing accounts, one *contextualist* the other *relativist*.

But the argument from disagreement is a *non sequitur*. Even granting the value of intuition in this case {% include ref.html id="vonfintel2008,cappelen2009" o="n" e="," %}

## Discourse role

Participants in a conversation are differentiated in terms of their role in the discoruse. Principal among these roles are the *speaker* and the *audience*. Obviously, participant roles are not assigned once off at the outset of the discoruse; instead, the individual filling each role changes as the discourse evolves.

Plausibly, interpretation is sensitive to features of the extra-lingusitic context. And context is not necessarily a monolithic thing. For instance, we can imagine different roles generating distinct elements of the context. And perhaps components supplied by one role may confict with components supplied by another. This picture makes salient the question whether discourse role is a determinative element of context that is relevant to interpretation.

Certainly, there are expressions that reference the entity filling different discourse roles. The personal pronouns (in English, *I* and *you* as examples) are plausibly interpreted as refering to individuals on the basis of the role they fill. But the fact that a member of the *audience* is referred to by an expression in the language does not make the language *relativist* in nature. For in this guise, the role is merely an element of the context, and the context is plausibly fixed by the situation of utterance.

But roles can also be seen as *context generators*, things that supply contextual features for interpretation. One interpretation of relativism is that audience role is an operative context generator for interpretation of certain expressions.

An interesting relativism demands a notion of *supplying* a context. Otherwise, all features can be seen as elements of *the one* context. It's not that the contextual feature is at a distance from the speaker, but that the feature is *supplied* by something at a distance from the utterance. The framework must allow for *variable application* of contextual features. Genuine relativism is *non-determinate* context generation relevant to interpretation.

### Two properties of relativism

Rel/Con 1: Who's context matters? (MacFarlane's *relativism/contextualism*)
Rel/Con 2: Context neutrality (MacFarlane's *indexicalism/non-indexicalism*)

1. That there are multiple values for some contextual feature that are potentially relevant to interpretation.
2. That which value is operative is not determined at the point of utterance. (Lasersohn pp.35-43)

Participant role can ground both properties. It generates a context and expressions reference it in specification of their interpretation.

But since role is dynamic, so too is interpretation. An addition to the information state can change value in response to further additions, if those additions reference participant role.

This feature of relativism is brought out in two important elements of language:
+ Attitude verbs
+ Speech acts

Disagreement (attitudinally, when mental, speech actly, when verbal) is not just about the nature of the content, it is about how evaluation of the content takes place. It needs both content neutrality and evaluation fixing (shiftyness).

There is no essential connection between the two elements. We can have audience sensitivity without content neutrality (MacF indexical relativism), and we can have content neutrality without relativism (absolutism). But maybe content neutrality is closer to relativism than we thought. For determinate assessment sensitivity is not all that relative. What's relative is that evaluation is indeterminate -- that different people can evaluate differently the same content without fault (Koelbel, de Sa)

CIA picture: what context is relevant?
+ Evidence suggests that the question is misplaced. Either can be relavant.
+ But the response of dismissing assessor sensitivity entirely is too swift.
+ Let's give some teeth to the *cloud of contexts* idea.



## Two sides of belief

In one sense, Brisco and Green's disagree in their beliefs. Brisco thinks it was the guy in room A that did it, while Green thinks it was the one in room B, and the person who did it acted alone. In another sense, they agree in what they believe.  Belief is functionally tied to action, and Brisco and Green are acting in very similar ways.

The fact that sameness of belief is two sided in this way is brought out in the differences between a relativist and a contextualist approach to the attitudes. Relativists take belief to be a relation to a property; one that a person stands in when she self-ascribes that property. The agreement between Brisco and Green comes from their both self-ascribing the property of *currently interrogating the culprit*. Their disagreement comes from the fact that Brisco self-ascribes the property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room A* and Green self-ascribes the incompatible property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room B*.

The contextualist views the situation differently. Belief, for the contextualist, is a relation between an individual and a proposition. But propositions have parts, and belief need not be stable across changes in the parts of propositions. But context infects the relation as well, and one's relation to a proposition need not be stable across changes in context. So, Brisco and Green definitely disagree.  Hold the context fixed, and Brisco stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room A*, while Green stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room B*. Since individual people don't co-locate, these relations cannot both represent reality. But, it may yet *appear* that they agree. After all, both Brisco and Green would honestly tell the Liutenant ``I'm subjecting the culprit to interrogation''. But the contextualist denies that honest reporting tells the whole story, for our words build context in, and the belief relation extracts it.

Disagreement has been a bit of a star figure in recent debates in the philosophy of language. Primarily, it has been used as a tool for assessing the adequacy of different proposals for the semantic contribution of certain expressions. The contestants in battle disagreement are <i>absolutism</i>, <i>contextualism</i>, and <i>relativism</i>, and the standard scorecard has absolutism and relativism coming out on top in virtue of their ability to secure constant content across uses of the expression. Genuine disagreement does seem to require something toward which utterances can entail incompatible commitments, but semantic content is not the only contribution an utterance makes to discourse. Contextualism can appeal other elements of utterances, which may both remain constant and serve as the seat of disagreement.

The difference between contextualism and relativism is generally couched in terms of content, but content is not the only semantically relevant element of linguistic utterances. Also associated with what we say is a context change potential. A different way of representing the difference between contextualism and relativism is not in terms of what they mean but what they do.

If Brisco and Green both believe that they've got the culprit, then they will act in similar ways. They'll look to elicit a confession, offer up bargains, or threaten physical violence. But if Brisco's suspect is in confession room A while Green's is in B, then their actions will have quite different import. Contextualism aligns with absolutism in taking belief to be a relation between a subject and a proposition; a relation that holds just in case the subject takes the proposition to accurately represent the world she inhabits.	Relativism differs in taking belief to be a relation between a subject and a property; a relation that holds just in case the subject self-ascribes the property. (Perhaps not all relativists would be happy with this characterization, taking belief to be a three-place relation among a subject, proposition, and a perspective. But a perspectival proposition is itself a relation; curry that relation and you're left with a property.)
