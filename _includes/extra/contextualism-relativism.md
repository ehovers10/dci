## Meaning and context

Utterance meaning is sensitive to context, but who determines the context appropriate to evaluating an utterance? There is pressure to say that the speaker controls the meaning of her words. After all, Grice taught us that speaker meaning is intentional. The speaker is most intimately connected to what she has said, and must retain some right to determining what she meant by what she said.

But Humpty Dumpty took things too far.

> 'When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, 'it means just what I choose it to mean â€” neither more nor less.'

Convention determines the meaning of the words one utters, though context can be influential in determining what word it is that is uttered.

But there is also pressure from the other side to say that utterance interpretation is relative. It is a common contention that words can mean different things to different people.

There is a source of linguistic evidence that promises to break this stalemate.

**The argument from disagreement**

1. Intuitions about genuine disagreement are pertinent to theorizing about linguistic content.

    + In this sense, facts about genuine disagreement are similar to facts about truth conditions and anaphora resolution.

2. Genuine disagreement requires shared content on which the disputing parties take conflicting stances.

    + A principal feature of content is that it is truth-conditional. In so far as uttering a sentence in context commits one to a belief in its content, one form of disagreement is realized when two parties are committed to conflicting beliefs with a single proposition as their base content. For instance, one individual believes *A* and another believes its negation *&not;A*.

3. Relativism posits a *context neutral* content.

    + There is a single content that is expressed in both party's speech or thought. Each party assigns to that content a different truth value; thus, the disagreement. But such contents are complex objects, and the conflicting assignments can each be accurate for the part to which they pertain; thus the sense that each party exerts a right in their assignment.

4. Contextualism issues in context specific contents.

    + Such contents build contextual features into them. Assignment of conflicting truth values to the same sentence amounts to assignment of truth values to distinct propositions. Each party can be correct in the assignment they make, but the sense of genuine disagreement is lost.

The argument from disagreement is a schema that can be applied to specific questions regarding the nature of content as a means of helping to dscide between competing accounts, one *contextualist* the other *relativist*.

But the argument from disagreement is a *non sequitur*. Even granting the value of intuition in this case {% include ref.html id="vonfintel2008,cappelen2009" o="n" e="," %}

## Two sides of belief

In one sense, Brisco and Green's disagree in their beliefs. Brisco thinks it was the guy in room A that did it, while Green thinks it was the one in room B, and the person who did it acted alone. In another sense, they agree in what they believe.  Belief is functionally tied to action, and Brisco and Green are acting in very similar ways.

The fact that sameness of belief is two sided in this way is brought out in the differences between a relativist and a contextualist approach to the attitudes. Relativists take belief to be a relation to a property; one that a person stands in when she self-ascribes that property. The agreement between Brisco and Green comes from their both self-ascribing the property of *currently interrogating the culprit*. Their disagreement comes from the fact that Brisco self-ascribes the property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room A* and Green self-ascribes the incompatible property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room B*.

The contextualist views the situation differently. Belief, for the contextualist, is a relation between an individual and a proposition. But propositions have parts, and belief need not be stable across changes in the parts of propositions. But context infects the relation as well, and one's relation to a proposition need not be stable across changes in context. So, Brisco and Green definitely disagree.  Hold the context fixed, and Brisco stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room A*, while Green stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room B*. Since individual people don't co-locate, these relations cannot both represent reality. But, it may yet *appear* that they agree. After all, both Brisco and Green would honestly tell the Liutenant ``I'm subjecting the culprit to interrogation''. But the contextualist denies that honest reporting tells the whole story, for our words build context in, and the belief relation extracts it.

Disagreement has been a bit of a star figure in recent debates in the philosophy of language. Primarily, it has been used as a tool for assessing the adequacy of different proposals for the semantic contribution of certain expressions. The contestants in battle disagreement are <i>absolutism</i>, <i>contextualism</i>, and <i>relativism</i>, and the standard scorecard has absolutism and relativism coming out on top in virtue of their ability to secure constant content across uses of the expression. Genuine disagreement does seem to require something toward which utterances can entail incompatible commitments, but semantic content is not the only contribution an utterance makes to discourse. Contextualism can appeal other elements of utterances, which may both remain constant and serve as the seat of disagreement.

The difference between contextualism and relativism is generally couched in terms of content, but content is not the only semantically relevant element of linguistic utterances. Also associated with what we say is a context change potential. A different way of representing the difference between contextualism and relativism is not in terms of what they mean but what they do.

If Brisco and Green both believe that they've got the culprit, then they will act in similar ways. They'll look to elicit a confession, offer up bargains, or threaten physical violence. But if Brisco's suspect is in confession room A while Green's is in B, then their actions will have quite different import. Contextualism aligns with absolutism in taking belief to be a relation between a subject and a proposition; a relation that holds just in case the subject takes the proposition to accurately represent the world she inhabits.	Relativism differs in taking belief to be a relation between a subject and a property; a relation that holds just in case the subject self-ascribes the property. (Perhaps not all relativists would be happy with this characterization, taking belief to be a three-place relation among a subject, proposition, and a perspective. But a perspectival proposition is itself a relation; curry that relation and you're left with a property.)
