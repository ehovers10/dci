[^inquiryStalnaker]:
    According to this initial explication, the machinery of inquiry properly includes that presumed by the conception preferred by Robert Stalnaker in which inquiry is "the enterprise of forming, testing, and revising beliefs" {% include appendices/ref.html id="stalnaker1987" o="" e="," p='ix' %}. As will become clear in what follows, there is no reason to restrict inquiry to operations on states of *belief*, nor ought we to presume that forming, testing, and revising exhaust the inquiry-relevant operations on mental states.

[^knowtoomuch]:
    Set aside the sense of *knowing too much* in which an agent has information that it would be in their other interests to remain ignorant of.

[^inclusion]:
    This is not completely true; we can make sense of one state strictly containing another.

[^brisco]:
    In one sense, Brisco and Green disagree in their beliefs. Brisco thinks it was the guy in room A that did it, while Green thinks it was the one in room B. They both think that the person who did it acted alone. In another sense, they agree in what they believe.  Belief is functionally tied to action, and Brisco and Green are acting in very similar ways. While Brisco is putting the screws to the guy in room A, Green has got the guy in room B under a hot lamp. They both have drafted warrant requests, and have finger prints running through the database checker.

[^centeredworlds]:
    Perhaps not all relativists would be happy with this characterization, taking belief to be a three-place relation among a subject, proposition, and a perspective. But a perspectival proposition is itself a relation; curry that relation and you're left with a property.

[^contextualistflavor]:
    There are different flavors of contextualism (Stanley, DeRose, Glanzberg, etc) and the differences might make a difference for certain applications. But I'm happy to treat the version in the text as representative in regard to the issue of disagreement.

[^ConversationalForce]:
    The notion in the text of *contribution type* is related to Paul Portner's *conversational force*, which he sees of as a notion, distinct from illocutionary force, that has implications for aspects of the grammatical system relating to syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

[^QACongruence]:
    We'll revisit the anticipation and restriction of questions later on when we discuss focus and Q/A Congruence in [Dispute in Discourse](/chapters/dispute-in-discourse.html)

[^supposition]:
    They are also similar to suppositions in that they seem to be less than fully committal on the part of the speaker. Assertion is generally associated with a commitment that it generates for the speaker.  This commitment involves some evidential relation between the asserter and the information conveyed, though it is controversial just what relation it is. But whatever the relation amounts to, it seems clear that we sometimes offer contributions to discourse that go beyond the evidence we have available. And we do this not just as a means of flouting the rules of discourse, but frequently in order to respect the project of the communicative exchange.

[^connection]:
    Jonathan Schaffer {% include appendices/ref.html id="schaffer2005" o="" %} also explores of the nature of knowledge in terms of its connection to inquiry, though his development of the nature of inquiry differs from that in the text.

[^command]:
    Sometimes added to this list of contribution types is the *command*, which proposes a non-linguistic demand upon a participant in the inquiry. The appropriate response to such a contribution is to make the world such that the demand is met (or to reject the demand itself).

[^mood]:
    Each of these contribution types has an associated linguistic mood. Inquiry is a structured process, in which it is important not only what information is available but also how it is to be put to use in reaching the goal. As an implementation of inquiry, linguistic discourse has conventional means of representing how the information is being put to use by a contribution. But the scope of contribution types is not limited by the set of conventional moods. Nor do I think the concept of *linguistic mood* cuts along the same joints as that of *contribution type*. What is important for a contribution type is that there is a recognizably unique way in which information is put to use to further the goals of the inquiry.

[^ability]:
    Is this true? Haven't I build *actual* collaboration into the framework by way of the sandbox?

[^goldman]:
    As would Alvin Goldman's {% include appendices/ref.html id="goldman1976" o="" %} fake barn cases among others.

[^refinement]:
    This picture is fitting for our account of refinement to be addressed in the last chapter.

[^multiknowledge]:
    It is thus a consequence of Levi's approach to inquiry as transition between states of knowledge following the dictates of a revision operator that there can be multiple, incompatible states of knowledge.

[^agm]:
    The classic treatment of contraction is AGM (Alchourron 1985), and I refer the reader there for details on the relation.

[^contain]:
    Even in the case of containment, having more information does not necessarily make the state more desirable. The more informative state involves one way of expanding from the less informative one. But independent of knowledge of the *alternative* expansions, there is no saying that such an expansion ought to be carried out.

[^factivity]:
    For a dissenting opinion, see {% include appendices/ref.html id="hazlett2012" o="n" e="." %}

[^intellectualism]:
    I focus here on *intellectualist* accounts of knowledge , setting aside explanations of non-canonical knowledge ascriptions that treat them as picking out a distinct kind of knowledge, one that characterizes some non-mental features of an individual, such as an *ability* they possess {% include appendices/ref.html id="ryle1949,lewis1988,bengson2012" o="n" e="." %}

[^informationpotential]:
    In other work, Levi has attempted to incorporate the truth acquisition element of the Jamesian amendment {% include appendices/ref.html id="levi1967,rott2006" o="n" e="." %} He defines a sentence's *information potential* -- a real-number value normalized to [0,1]. This value can then be used with an inquirer's subjective probability function to determined whether the sentence is worth adding to their information state.

[^internalism]:
    In yet other words, the stability of belief requires not just that the agent has knowledge, but that he *knows that* he does. And for someone else's words, directed toward modal conditions on knowledge generally, see {% include appendices/ref.html id="gardiner" o="n" e="." %}

[^swamping]:
    Ernest Sosa {% include appendices/ref.html id="sosa2003" o="" %} also develops this worry for reliabilism.

[^virtue]:
    Other developments of virtue epistemology motivated by the purported value of knowledge can be found in {% include appendices/ref.html id="riggs2009,sosa2003" o="n" e="." %}

[^epiphenomenalvalue]:
    One may at this point simply put their foot down and claim that the epistemic value problem is solved when we finger a feature of knowledge that makes the knower better off than the mere believer, even if the betterness is epiphenomenal. This seems to be the idea behind many virtue epistemological solutions {% include appendices/ref.html id="riggs2009,zagzebski2003" o="n" e="." %} Knowledge is a virtue; it thus adds to a life, whether the knower cares about it or not. It's hard to say exactly what our intuition in the epistemic value problem is tracking, and I don't have an argument that it can't be such an epiphenomenal value. But I think we do have reason to think that knowledge adds practical value over mere true belief, and I hope that my positive account lends credence to my diagnosis of the value problem.

    Virtue epistemological solutions, in so far as they posit a distinctive value possessed by knowledge, must also explain why not all knowledge is valuable. Sosa's {% include appendices/ref.html id="sosa2003" o="" %} example of the beachcomber who acquires knowledge of the number of grains of sand in his palm the hard way does not acquire something valuable. But he has knowledge just the same, and if there is a distinctive epistemic virtue, then his life ought to be better off for the counting.

[^conditionalization]:
    More or less the system outlined above, perhaps augmented with a probability function and a mechanism for accommodating evidence that supports a proposition without pushing it into the realm of full belief.

[^interleaved]:
    There are many ways to make sense of interleaved contents, and I don't see that the basic structure of inquiry requires any one type of interleaved content. But a quite natural one is *structural interleaving* -- contributions have components, and different contributions are interleaved to the extent that they share components. I will make use of this notion of interleaved content in my account of contrastive predication in [Dispute in Discourse](/chapters/dispute-in-discourse.html).

[^peircetesting]:
    This conception of induction is present in Peirce's writings as well:

    > The operation of testing a hypothesis by experiment, which consists in remarking that, if it is true, observations made under certain conditions ought to have certain results, and then causing those conditions to be fulfilled, and noting the results, and if they are favourable, extending a certain confidence to the hypothesis, I call *induction*. (Peirce, Abduction and Induction, p. 152)

    Note that there is no mention in this description of case or generalizations. Presumably, Peirce would further agree that in the instance where the results of the test are not favourable, a certain renunciation or adjustment of the hypothesis is in order.
