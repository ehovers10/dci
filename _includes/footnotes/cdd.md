[^Bestsystem]:
    Lewis also adds *fit* as a criterion for theorizing about non-deterministic systems. See {% include appendices/ref.html id="hicks2014" o="n" %} for an amendment of the best system account that incorporates the idea that the conditions of use of a theory may count as a criterion for adequacy of the theory.

[^collabattitudes]:
    I can see at least two ways of incorporating the collaborative extension of the basic ideology. We could add additional attitudes to the set of intentional elements whose content our theory is to specify, which is to say that we treat *conjectures* and *corrections* as independent states of mind. Alternatively, we could reimagine the attitudes we already grant, imbuing them with collaborative features, resulting in, perhaps, *distributed beliefs* and *shared desires*. The choice depends on whether we think of collaboration as built into the content or as a structural feature of the states. I don't see the need to make the choice for the purpose of examining the extension of the basic ideology. As far as I can tell, the consequences for the constraints on radical interpretation are the same.

[^frameproblem]:
    Think here of the challenge in artificial intelligence known as the *frame problem*. The issue is that good at data collection and processing as machines are, they have difficulty using their skills to engage tasks in the real world because there is simply too much data to sift through in order to process all of it before making a choice on how to act. Humans do this quite easily, despite the severe deficiency in our raw data processing ability. Presumably, we succeed on the basis of a set of frames, heuristics, and defaults, which allow us to filter the data, making the processing task much less onerous. Whatever the reductive link between the logical specification of language and its neurological realization may be, it seems evident that its rules must be specified in terms of these sorts of heuristics and defaults simply because it is a quotidian tool.

[^Semprag]:
    See the entries in [That sem/prag anthology].

[^Bontly]:
    Same idea as the simplicity motivation in linguistic theory that {% include appendices/ref.html id="bontly2005" o='n' %} discusses? Something about semantic innocence?

[^Morecriteria]:
    An additional criteria that seem to straddle the line between empirical coverage and theoretical virtue are is the distribution patterns of expressions throughout the language, such as an expression's embedding proclivities or the diversity of linguistic contexts in which it occurs

[^bealer]:
    George Bealer {% include appendices/ref.html id="bealer1997" %} emphasizes the counter-intuitiveness of reductive functionalist accounts in that they require the content of our conscious experiences to be weird realizer properties rather than the normal mental properties that really are their contents.

[^method]:
    Or at least *a* methodology. To fix ideas, I presume as operative Lewis' *Method 3* {% include appendices/ref.html id="lewis1974b" p="342" %} for linguistic theory construction.

[^constitutive]:
    Both constitutive and regulative rules count as rules in this sense as both are generalizations over singular game events. Their different status is a distinction without a difference in our framework. In this sense, they are like the differences between laws and initial conditions for best systems accounts of laws.

[^reflexive]:
    Call the application of metrics in the game evolution *strategies* and the elements of the system applying the strategies *players*.

[^usability]:
    The claim is not that there is a direct correlation of grammatical structure with neuro-psychological structure. Or that a single scoreboard-plus-rulebook perfectly represents what a game player has internalized. But that understanding requires strucutral representation, we hold as determined. And that certain understanding-based capabilities depend on a specific structural representation is something I'm willing to insist on.

[^compositionality]:
    Though we have to be careful. Truth determination can be shown to be compositional. For other grammatical roles, it may be harder to demonstrate this feature. We should be ok with refinement coherence, because we will represent it in terms of focus semantic values, which are compositional.

[^gametheory]:
    Despite termoinological similarities, the classification project taken up in the text is altogether different from that of game theory. My interest is not on how players rationally choose strategies within a well-defined game structure. Instead, I'm interested in the process of defining game structure itself. Game theory is best applied in situations of prescriptive rulebooks, as understood in the main text.

    I attempt to forestall the confusion by shifting focus from *games* themselves to *characterizing descriptions* thereof. Thus, the emphasis is on the theory of a game, which is our actual point of interest.

    It's important not to confuse topics here. It's possible that the language here specified is used by a population, and it's possible that its being so used is a matter of convention. And it's further possible that conventional use is to be explained in terms of game-theoretic solutions to a coordination problem. But all of that is aside from our point here, which is to provide a grammar for a possible language. In particular, it is to provide the interpretational element of that grammar. The assumption in the text is that being a genuine grammar requires a usability constraint, and usability is explicated in terms of concepts of language as a game.
