Plans are a form of commitment regarding future action. We understand the nature of plans on the basis of the role that they play in agents' attempts to successfully navigate the world -- their efforts at *practical reasoning*. Practical reason is the process of applying reasons in order to act in the way that best enables one to achieve her goals.

In circumstances calling for action, agents are faced with choice sets. Choice sets are the alternative actions available to the agent. The purpose of practical reasoning is to decide amongst the alternatives in a choice set. Decision is a two-step process. In order to pick the preferred element from within a choice set, one must first have a means of determining the membership of the choice set.

First, choice sets are non-maximal sets of incompatible actions. Their non-maximality is due to the cognitive and practical limitations of human actors. Perhaps ideal reasoners could engage in practical reasoning by selecting one action from amongst all possibilities full stop. But human reasoners surely do not do this, nor does it seem appropriate to contend that they ought to. There are two principle reasons why choice sets must contain only a limited number of alternatives. The first is that the decision process takes both time and cognitive resources. If agents are to avoid paralysis, they must have a means of distributing these resources over a mere handful of chocies. Additionally, agents come to the decision table with certain conceptual proclivities and limitations. Certain actions that may in principle serve to achieve their goals will simply not be genuine options for them. Blindness to certain options may arise due to the agent's evolutionary and social history. We do not want to say that agents who cannot assess their prospects for action with complete accuracy are precluded from engaging in proper practical reasoning.

My goal is not to provide a theory of how human agents solve the problem honing choice sets generally, but I think we can mention a couple broad categories of factors that enter into their determination. There are such factors as the evolutionary and social history of the agent. In a very real sense, our upbringing influences our decision making process both in how we assess the relative merits of the options before us and in what we take to be the genuine options. To take a familiar example, in deliberating on what to eat, I may be deliberating between pizza and seafood; while fried salamander may also be an available option, it is possible that such a consideration never even enters into the mix. And this need not indicate a failure of rationality on my part; it is simply the result of a-rational processes of choice limitation deriving from my causal heritage. There are similar factors in play that have less far reaching causal histories. Certain features of my circumstances may make it such that I don't percieve the viability of plausible options. Because these limitations imposed on the choice set derive from a-rational/non-cognitive features of the agent's circumstance, let's label them *saliency restrictions*. They are in essence the factors that determine a choice as a *live option* in William James' sense. 

The arational character of saliency conditions means they lack normativity. They involve evolutionarily and socially instilled blinders that guide choice restriction without appeal to rational choice by the agent. However, there is an important sense in which there are certain options that an agent *should* consider. If salience were the sole mechanism by which choice sets were determined, then agents could simplify their decision making without fault simply by responding to situations dogmatically (Cf. Hawthorne XXX). While it is likely that salience plays some role in the choice set determination phase, if this phase is genuinely an element of practical reason,  then salience cannot be the whole story.

A second category of factors that plausibly limit the options in the choice set are more cognitive in nature. It is frequently the case that certain possibilities are simply irrelevant to the circumstances of the agent. Relevance is a tricky notion, but, following Jason Stanley, we can think of the irrelevant choices as those whose performance would not change one's circumstances in any way (Knowledge and Practical Interests, p. XXX).

In large part, whether performance of an action alters one's circumstances depends on their interests in those circumstances. The role of interests in decision making is to determine the goals toward which our actions are to be directed. However, as such, they are indifferent to the means by which those goals are achieved. 

We can further assume that choice sets involve pairwise incompatible options in the sense that the agent's choice to perform one action precludes his ability to perform any other in the set. This assumption stems from the conception of practical reason as the process of distributing a limited arsenal of practical resources. If the options before the agent do not preclude each other, then there is little sense to be made of the claim that the end result of any deliberation over that set is more rational than the other.

### The vaule of plans

An agent's interests contribute to their choice set determination by filtering out the actions that do not serve their purposes, and salience further hones the options by eliminating the possibilities that are not feasible for the agent given her background. But even after the contribution of these factors, we may be left with a relatively large array of options. What is even worse for effective decision making, agents are constantly beset with changing options. Even when we aren't being fickle about our interests, the environment constantly impinges on us in unexpected ways. To deal with this fact, rational agents form plans. Planning serves the project of effective decision making in a number of ways. Formost among those is its ability to provide a stable background against the ever changing environment. When we form plans, we establish certain checkpoints on the way to our goals as fixed, and we adjust our choices to align with those fixed points as much as possible.

Plans establish stability, but they are not immutable. There are two ways in which plans allow for adjustment of action with time. First, plans can be *structurally incomplete*. For instance, I may form a plan to buy lunch from the deli on the way into the office, but my plan need not factor in the means of paying for lunch. So, if I happen to spend all my cash at the bar the night before, I can still stick to the plan by paying for lunch with a credit card the next morning. Second, plans can be *corrigible*. Sometimes plans are ill-conceived, and even good plans can be undermined if outside forces so conspire. It is a sign of a rational agent to correct plans as need be.

Planning is one way in which resource-bounded agents limit the demands on their cognitive resources. In setting plans into action, the agent takes certain future actions to be given, thus constraining the alternatives the agent must take into consideration as time progresses. But the plans must not be too constraining. As Bratman et al. put it:

> Given the requirement of stability, plans should also be partial. In addition to bounded computational resources, agents have bounded knowledge. They are neither prescient nor omniscient: the world may change around them in ways they are not in a position to anticipate. Hence highly detailed plans about the far future will often be of little use, the details not worth worrying about. (pp. 9-10)

Partiality guarantees for stability by allowing the agent to fill in the details when they become pertinent. A level of open-endedness allows the plan to remain relatively intact even in the face of unanticipated change. Then, at the time of action, standing plans serve to filter out certain alternatives. If an alternative action is incompatible with the outline of the plan, then it is ignored. 

Thus, in combination with salience and interests, plans complete the winnowing of options required for agents to effectively use their resources in deliberation. However, the knowledge limitations that make stability so crucial also put limitations on the advisability of steadfast adherence to plans. Again, Bratman et al:

> A rational agent's current plans must not have irrevocable control over her future deliberation and behavior. Rather a rational agent should sometimes be willing to reconsider her plans in light of unanticipated events. There thus exists a tension between the stability that plans must exhibit to play their role in focusing practical reasoning and the recovability that must also be inherent in them, given that they are formed on the basis of incomplete information about the future. (p. 15)

To accommodate revocability, agents utilize a *filter override mechanism*. In rational agents, this mechanism is sensitive enough to trigger when plans need to be reconsidered without being so sensitive as to undermine the stability that plans provide.
