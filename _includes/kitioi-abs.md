It is commonly held that knowledge is the end of inquiry, but if we take this connection seriously, there are significant implications for our understanding of the nature of knowledge. I propose to take at face value the idea that knowledge is whatever we get as output in the process of inquiry. Delving into the nature of inquiry reveals that it is a *collaborative* endeavor, and so, then is knowledge. This idea has important consequences for explaining the distinctive value of knowledge over true belief and for the contextualism/relativism debate in epistemology.
