<p>In DRT, conjunction and quantification are interpreted representationally. The system leverages structural features of the interpretation framework to capture their effects.</p>

<p>The result is that these phenomena are not treated in a parallel manner to disjunction, negation, and implication. We thus have a violation of semantic innocence, and perhaps compositionality more broadly.</p>

<p>The logical operators that are present work on DRSs rather than formulas. Negation is a function from one DRS to another, implication and disjunction are relations between DRSs.</p>
