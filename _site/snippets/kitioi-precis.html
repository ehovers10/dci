<h1 id="concept">Knowledge in the image of inquiry</h1>

<p>It is tempting to maintain that the <a id="end-of-inquiry" href="/glossary#end-of-inquiry" class="tooled gloss">end of inquiry</a><span id="end-of-inquiry-tip" class="tooltip glossary"><b>end of inquiry</b>: The goal state of the process of inquiry, generally resolution of the issue(s) for which the inquiry was undertaken, as well as any sub-issues raised during course of the inquiry.</span> is truth. While possession of the truth may be what the inquirer is after, she wishes to possess it in such a way that she both <em>recognizes</em> and <em>accepts</em> it as the truth. The goal of engaging in inquiry is to achieve a <em>cognitive</em> state with true propositions as its content.</p>

<p>In contrast, C.S. Peirce and others following in his wake (<a id="levi1980" class="ref tooled" href="#ref-levi1980"><span class="author">Levi </span><span class="date"><span class="year">1980</span></span></a>), have suggested that truth is too lofty a goal; that the most we can genuinely hope for at the end of inquiry is the <em>settlement of opinion</em>, for:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“it is clear that nothing out of the sphere of our knowlege can be our object, for nothing which does not affect the mind can be the motive for mental effort. The most that can be maintained is, that we seek for a belief that we shall <em>think</em> to be true. But we think each one of our beliefs to be true, and indeed, it is mere tautology to say so.” (<a id="peirce1877" class="ref tooled" href="#ref-peirce1877"><span class="author">Peirce </span><span class="date"><span class="year">1877/1955</span></span><span class="pages">,  p. 11</span></a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In response, we could take the pragmatist bait and insist that truth is the end of inquiry simply because whatever is output from the process of inquiry <em>just is</em> truth. But we needn’t take this line. We can cleave to a correspondence account of truth while maintaining that final aim of inquiry involves <a id="wide-content" href="/glossary#wide-content" class="tooled gloss">wide content</a><span id="wide-content-tip" class="tooltip glossary"><b>wide content</b>: Mental content that essentially involves a part of the mind-external world.</span> by delimiting a natural, restricted category of <em>proper</em> inquiry that can be reliably expected to produce true propositions.</p>

<p>Principally, proper inquiry is a rule governed process. Rule-following has the practical advantage of improving the reliability of the inquiry, but the connection to rule following is a conceptual one. The cognitive state that the inquirer seeks is <em>praiseworthy</em>, and one does not garner praise simply by stumbling onto true propositions. Undertaking the process of inquiry is important to earning the accolades that come with possessing the truth.</p>

<p>The end of inquiry, then is a valuable, cognitive state with true propositions as its content. Specifically, proper inquiry is a process that reliably produces justified, true belief. Modulo Gettier-type complications, the end of inquiry is <em>knowledge</em>.</p>

<p>If we had a solid understanding of the nature of knowledge, we could use the <em>end of</em> connection to extend our understanding to encompass inquiry as well. But the nature of knowledge is highly contested, and connections go both ways. I propose to investigate the basic structure of proper inquiry by looking to specific historical accounts of its importance, to take at face value the idea that the outputs of the process of inquiry are knowledge, and thereby to provide insight into the structure of the knowledge relation.</p>

<p>The key insight that arises from this investigation into proper inquiry is that it is a deeply collaborative process. By way of the <em>end of</em> connection, we have reason to represent the knowledge relation as similarly collaborative. In one sense, this idea is quite radical, in that it seems to eliminate the potential for solipsitic knowledge. But we can perhaps buff a few of the burrs off this conceptual edge, and the proposal garners support from the puzzles it can help to solve.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-and-the-process-of-justification">Knowledge and the process of justification</h2>

<p>One such puzzle derives from the fact that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief, but as far as all one wants is to get to Larissa, a merely true belief will do as well as a justified, true one. The <em>swamping problem</em> is that there seems to be no value over and above the truth of the justified belief provided by its being so justified.</p>

<p>Reliabilist accounts of knowledge offer a reasonable story about the justification process, but they go wrong in suggesting that the value inherent in the process transfers over to its product. Linda Zagzebski (<a id="zagzebski2003" class="ref tooled" href="#ref-zagzebski2003"><span class="date"><span class="year">2003</span></span></a>) maintains that this problem suffices to undermine the reliabilist approach. But this is true only if we commit to treating knowledge as merely the output of a justifiying process. If we build the process into the knowledge relation, there is no need for the value to <em>transfer</em> at all.</p>

<p>The reliability of beliefs formed via inquiry is incidental. The central virtue of inquiry is that it provides one with an account. It allows an individual to stand up to challenges of their belief. And possessing this is more valuable than merely possessing the true belief. Socrates speculates with Meno that what separates knowledge from true belief is that knowledge is tied down by an account. The account doesn’t get you to Larissa any more surely, but it can help you respond to detractors you find along the route. And this ability is worth posessing.</p>

<p>The inquiry-first account of knowledge is compatible with a view in which knowledge is the constitutive norm of <a id="assertion" href="/glossary#assertion" class="tooled gloss">assertion</a><span id="assertion-tip" class="tooltip glossary"><b>assertion</b>: A conversational contribution that adds information to the common ground (either provisionally or automatically). An interlocutor undertakes certain commitments related to the truth of the content asserted in offering this contribution.</span>. But it is ecumenical, in that this does not mean giving up on the virutes of a commitment-based account of the speech act (<a id="macfarlane2005" class="ref tooled" href="#ref-macfarlane2005"><span class="author">MacFarlane </span><span class="date"><span class="year">2005</span></span></a>). Since knowledge contains the commitment fulfilling process of inquiry as a part, it can serve as both the norm of assertion and ground the constitutivity of other commitments engendered by assertion.</p>

<h2 id="dispute-and-collaborate">Dispute and collaborate</h2>

<p>Disagreement has been a bit of a star figure in recent debates in the philosophy of language. Primarily, it has been used as a tool for assessing the adequacy of different proposals for the semantic contribution of certain expressions. Genuine disagreements, as opposed to spurious or merely apparent ones, intuitively require in the linguistic context or the minds of the disputants, the presence of some kind of content toward which the participants have incompatible commitments.</p>

<p>The contestants in battle disagreement are <em>absolutism</em>, <em>contextualism</em>, and <em>relativism</em>, and the standard scorecard has absolutism and relativism coming out on top in virtue of their ability to secure the requisite constant content across uses of the expression. Contextualism, it is charged, assigns contents to the utterances and thoughts of different individuals that have them incurring different, compatible commitments as a result of their utterances or thoughts.</p>

<p>Whatever stance we take on the outcome of this debate, disagreement does seem to be a valuable tool to have in the linguist’s toolkit.  Language users have intuitions about the compatibility of sentences used in discourse, and linguistic theories ought to respect those intutions. But simply marking the presence of incompatible contents in a discourse is a relatively peripheral role for disagreement to play in lingusitic theorizing. As they stand, the semantic theories considered above give no insight into disputative discourse itself; they merely accord to a greater or lesser extent with one interesting consequence of such discourse.</p>

<p>The previous discussion has shown that dispute plays a significant role in the very structure of knowledge. Given broadly accepted connections between knowledge and discourse maneuvers, it also has implications for understanding the nature of discourse dynamics.</p>
