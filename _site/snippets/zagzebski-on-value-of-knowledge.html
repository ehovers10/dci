<p>Zagzebski’s characterization of what she calls <em>the value problem</em> is that all definitions of knowledge that take it to be a value conferring property conjoined to a state of true belief will end up having the value of the conjoined property swamped by the value provided merely by the truth of the belief.</p>

<p>This is especially acute for what Zagzebski calls <em>machine-product</em> accounts of knowledge, on which knowledge is taken to be a state that is the output of some state generating process.</p>

<p>But the externalist element of these accounts is not the source of the worry, because internalist accounts that interpret the difference between justified and merely true belief in terms of <em>truth-conduciveness</em> also submit to the value problem. Once truth is achieved, truth-conduciveness provides nothing extra. Zagzebski directly addresses Lawrence Bonjour’s approach to justification, but the challenge would seemingly apply also to modal accounts such as Williamson’s <em>safety</em> account. If my belief is true in this world, I get little more out of it also being true in nearby worlds.</p>

<p>The moral Zagzebski takes from the value problem is that we must dismiss the machine-product view of knowledge and accept knowledge as a property of temporally extended agents.</p>

<p>But the problem isn’t with the machine-product model itself. The problem has to do with the nature of the product. We can imbue the product with the credit deserving feature –  the <em>account</em> of the state’s genesis. The problem is not the product, but that the process is seen as external to the product. But the insight of dynamic semantics is that these need not be independent. The product encodes the process.</p>

<p>Of course, there is still an issue with the unity of knowledge. Why don’t we still have a swamping issue, just now with one part of knowledge swamping the value provided by another part? The answer has to do with the idea of truth-conduciveness as value adding. We have an operational account of knowledge; we also understand truth operationally.</p>

<p>Conduciveness is not a modal property. It is dynamic. Take Meno’s first take reposne to Socrates: “The man who has knowledge will get there every time, whereas the man with true opinion will get there only sometimes.” I think this is the most natural characterization of the value of knowledge, and it is also the correct one. This is because knowledge isn’t valuable as a destination; it is valuable as a means to a destination.</p>

<p>A holistic, dynamic state encodes the process of inquiry, and this is knowledge. The individual beliefs abstracted from the state are known, but they are not the knowledge in so far as knowledge is value additive.</p>

<p>In the belief update literature, knowledge is understood as the fixation of belief. It is the set of worlds to which one does not consider alternatives. This perspective is unlikely to capture the colloquial English use of the word “knowledge”, for knowledge of this sort is not factive. But of additional concern for this account is the ability to set off a concept distinct from belief.</p>

<p>Knowledge is belief with an account.</p>

<p>Zagzebski suggests that the problem is that the value adding function is also the function that produces the belief. But if its value comes from its proficiency at producing true beliefs, then it’s value is also swamped by the truth of its product.</p>

<p>We can then (i) deny the machine-product model, (ii) devise another value for the production mechanism that is independent of the intrinsic properties of the end product, or (iii) expand the product to include parts that are both independently valuable and dependent upon the production means.</p>

<p>Ways Zagzebski explains the problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The external nature of the value adding property (unity)</li>
  <li>The fact that the value adding function is the producing function, and that the product has the value intrinsically (swamping)</li>
  <li>The machine-product model</li>
</ul>

<p>Zagzebski’s morals of the value problem</p>

<ol>
  <li>Truth plus a reliable source of truth cannot explain the value of knowledge</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>The value of truth, which the belief has intrinsically, swamps any value provided by a belief forming method that reliably produces truths.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Truth plus an independently valuable source cannot explain the value problem.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Value had by a cause need not transfer to its effects.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Knowing is not related to the knower as a machine to a product</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>If all knowing is is a kind of belief forming process, then it’s value is completely swamped by the value intrinsic to the product.</li>
</ul>

<p>Zagzebski’s alternative: Knowledge has value in conferring credit on the agent for the belief. It is not the output of an agent, it is a state of the agent.The agent is made better by believing in the way she does. The model for this is action. Acts are not products of agents, they are parts of agents because they include the intention. Thus, to get credit for an action is to value the agent for one of her intrinsic properties. Knowledge is similarly an intrinsic property of agents. As in action, belief is motivated, and the motivation makes the belief a property of the agent.</p>

<p>Zagzebski’s fn. 12 alternative: Knowledge is an organic unity containing both the belief and its formation process. The value of the whole thereby exceeds the value of the belief part.</p>

<p>JTB analyses do not in general succumb to the value problem: Justification is something added to the belief. The belief (itself) is justified. Thus, the belief is made better by the justification coferring process.</p>

<ul>
  <li>But truth-conducivity accounts of justification do succumb. For, it’s value is then in the product it brings about, and the product swamps it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, the point of further iterations of the reliabilist family of theories is an attempt to capture the modal character of reliability. And this modeal property is thought to be a property <em>of the belief</em>. The belief is stable, or safe, or sensitive, because of its relation to truth in different worlds. Not because of the properties possessed by different beliefs modally produced by the belief forming mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="the-external-account-of-the-value-problem">The external account of the value problem</h2>

<p>THe genuine moral of the value problem has to do with the external character of the proposed value adding property when knowledge is conceived of as a particular kind of belief state. The value added is swamped by the state already possessing the property it adds. But bringing the value adding element <em>into</em> the product is no progress if it is swamped by another of the product’s <em>parts</em>. The challenge is to say what <em>distinctive</em> value knowledge has over true opinion.</p>

<p>The answer is to characterize differently the nature of knowledge. It doesn’t work for it to be a sub-kind of belief. But we needn’t dismiss the useful machine-product model. We need only reconceive the product. We are left with an articulated state, and the threat of swamping looms anew. What we need is <em>value unity</em> that does not reduce to truth.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-the-problem-down">Breaking the problem down</h2>

<p>There are two parts that are needed for a complete response to the external property version of the value problem.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The value making property</li>
  <li>The nature of the value</li>
</ol>

<p>The adequacy criteria on the second element are that the value not reduce to, or be swamped by the truth of the belief state to which it is applied, and that it stem from the value making property.</p>

<p>If knowledge is an articulated state combining a fixated domain and an account, then what unifies it as a distinctly valuable state? In what sense is knowledge an <em>organic unity</em>? I suggest that it is the same feature that explains its distinction from mere belief states. It is operationally defined truth-conduciveness.</p>

<p><em>Truth-conduciveness</em> is a modal notion. It is valuable not in producing truth, but in its tendency  to produce truth. We can understand this either practically (in terms of proven past success) or operationally (with truth just being that thing generally produced by this procedure).^[consider Mill on the value of expressive freedom. It is valuable even when truth has been obtained. This is the case because truth attainment is not the value; maintaining support for the truth is.]</p>

<h2 id="williamson-on-the-value-of-knowledge">Williamson on the value of knowledge</h2>

<p>Knowledge provides stability with respect to future action (2000, p. 79-80). One who knows is in a better position to distrust misleading evidence. There is also an explanatory loss in moving from knowledge involving language to rational-true-belief involving language in explaining behavior. Why did the burglar look so long despite the risk of being caught? Because he knew they were in the house (p. 62). The probability of an action conditional on their knowing is greater than the probability of the action conditional on their merely truly believing.</p>

<p>Subjective certainty cannot replace knowing. Fixation of belief must allow for undoing.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-in-the-image-of-dynamic-semantics">Knowledge in the image of dynamic semantics</h2>

<p>Knowledge is the end of inquiry, but inquiry is a dynamic and integrated procedure. The end cannot be separated from the process. It’s operational in the sense that knowledge is what emerges from the process. Knowledge is also true, and we aren’t claiming that truth is operational. Instead, the process is conducive of truth, but operational of knowledge. And truth is valuable, but inquiry is only partially about the end of truth. It is also about the acquisition process.</p>

<p>Dynamic semantics calls for two changes to the traditional view of knowledge as a propositional attitude. Knowledge states are articulated to represent relations among the elements of the context set. And knowledge is continuously tested by discourse participants.</p>

<p>These are welcome additions on the basis of knowledge perceived as the end of inquiry. It also provides us with a means of answering the Meno Problem in an instrumental way, and without sacrificing the view of the justificatory procedure as a belief formation procedure. The machine-product model is not to be blithely dispensed with. Especially if the alternative to to take on the metaphysical implications associated with agentive causation and action evaluation. (Are actions really properties of agents?)</p>

<p>Knowledge is the end of belief, for belief is generated from the structured knowledge state.</p>
