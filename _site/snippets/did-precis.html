<h1 id="practice">Collaborative disagreement</h1>

<p>Disputes can be frivolous, fractured, and fraudulent. They can derail conversations, and generate so much animosity that perpetuating the dispute itself comes to mean more than the prospect of resolving it.  These disputes may have very little to do with actual conflict over the informational potential of the disputative language used to express them, instead being driven by <em>ad hominem</em> and <em>ad ideologiam</em> tendencies.</p>

<p>But dispute can also be a fruitful tool for people involved in an honest, cooperative attempt to further mutual knowledge. There is the ancillary fact that interlocutors sometimes lose track of the cooperative effort, and it is valuable to have a means of correcting them to bring them back on to the task at hand.  But dispute can play also more central role in the project of inquiry. As we have seen, the speech act of correction, in which an individual denies a proposal initiated by an interlocutor is a crucial element in properly vetting conjectures in discourse. As such, some element of dispute is central to the enterprise of inquiry. I contend that the conjecture/correction discourse pair provides a genuine contribution to inquiry. In the previous chapter, I motivated this status by providing a model of discourse dynamics that carves out a distinctive operation on information that this contribution makes. In this chapter I explore another criterion for genuine contributions: that it be represented in some conventionalized linguistic tool. I think that this tool is <a id="focus" href="/glossary#focus" class="tooled gloss">focus</a><span id="focus-tip" class="tooltip glossary"><b>focus</b>: An information structuring device of natural language. It serves to divide the content conveyed into parts based on the role they play in the broader dicourse. A principle such division is between given and new information. In English, focus is usually realized as intonational stress.</span>, and that the virtues of collaborative discourse dynamics come to prominence in explaining focus interpretation when we examine <a id="contrastive-topic" href="/glossary#contrastive-topic" class="tooled gloss">contrastive topic</a><span id="contrastive-topic-tip" class="tooltip glossary"><b>contrastive topic</b>: An information structural element located within the topic of a sentence that sets its scope in contrast to a (commonly contextually determined) set of alternatives.</span> specifically.</p>

<p>Consider the following little discourse:</p>

<div class="def" id="grizzly-ex"><div class="title"><span class="head">Example 1&nbsp;</span><span>(Grizzly)</span></div><div class="body fence">
<div class="example"><div class="item"><span class="name">A: </span><span class="content">Bears are dangerous.</span></div><div class="item"><span class="name">B: </span><span class="content">[Grizzly]<sub>cf</sub> bears are dangerous.</span></div></div>
</div></div>
<div id="grizzly-show-tip" class="tooltip defn"><b style="border-bottom: 1px solid #fff;">Grizzly</b><br />
  <div class="example"><div class="item"><span class="name">A: </span><span class="content">Bears are dangerous.</span></div><div class="item"><span class="name">B: </span><span class="content">[Grizzly]<sub>cf</sub> bears are dangerous.</span></div></div>
</div>

<p>Pretheoretically, the response utterance seems to do two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It denies an element of the preceding contribution to discourse.</li>
  <li>It provides a positive contribution that is related in a salient way to the previous contribution.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that it pulls off this dual task because it serves as a completion of the initiation provided by the first utterance. To motivate this claim, I look at two alternative accounts of this sort of disputative discourse and find them lacking.</p>

<h2 id="questions-under-discussion-and-plans-of-inquiry">Questions under discussion and plans of inquiry</h2>

<p>A salient feature of the <a href="#bears">Bears</a> dialogue is the presence of <a id="focus" href="/glossary#focus" class="tooled gloss">focus</a><span id="focus-tip" class="tooltip glossary"><b>focus</b>: An information structuring device of natural language. It serves to divide the content conveyed into parts based on the role they play in the broader dicourse. A principle such division is between given and new information. In English, focus is usually realized as intonational stress.</span> on <em>grizzly</em> in the response utterance. Focus is a lingusitic tool whose use serves primarily to <em>package</em> information as opposed to providing its own contribution. It distinguishes the elements of a sentence that are new to the discussion from those that have already been introduced, thus showing to the other participants in the discourse how the contribution is intended to fit in with what has preceeded. In this sense, focus has a distinctly <em>backward looking</em> function. It depends on, and responds to, previous moves in the conversation. So it makes sense that the most common analyses of focus interpretation assign it a <em>presuppositional</em> pragmatic function. Focus adds a <em>felicity condition</em> to the overall import of a sentence; the sentence is interpretable in situ only if material matching the focus semantic value of the sentence can be found in the previously constructed conversation.</p>

<p>The Question Under Discussion model of discourse dynamics, developed principally by Craige Roberts (<a id="roberts1998" class="ref tooled" href="#ref-roberts1998"><span class="date"><span class="year">1998</span></span></a>), expounds on the alternative semantics account by treating discourse as governed by a stack of questions. The governing question at any point in a discourse may have been explicitly asked or it may be implicit, presumed by the discourse participants and revealed in the information packaging of their utterances.</p>

<p>Daniel Büring (<a id="buering2003" class="ref tooled" href="#ref-buering2003"><span class="date"><span class="year">2003</span></span></a>) (,buering2008) extends the QUD model to capture second-occurrence focus, also called <em>contrastive topic</em>. But there is an issue in this extension when applied to cases such as the <a href="#bears">Bears</a> dialogue. It is not so much an issue of empirical coverage as it is a conceptual issue having to do with the role of corrections in discourse evolution. The QUD model of contrastive topic makes its discourse contribution entirely backward looking. Whatever role the focus plays is just a matter of checking prior discourse for an antecedent to the focus-generated alternative set.</p>

<p>The <a href="#bears">Bears</a> dialogue is an example of felicitous use of contrastive focus in which there is no expicit question on the table at all. It seems to me that the role of the focus in <a href="#bears">Bears</a> is more than simply to mark the way the response fits into previous discourse; it genuinely advances the inquiry along by correcting what predeeded. But to capture this added feature, we needn’t dispose of Büring’s useful <a id="plan-of-inquiry" href="/glossary#plan-of-inquiry" class="tooled gloss">plan of inquiry</a><span id="plan-of-inquiry-tip" class="tooltip glossary"><b>plan of inquiry</b>: The structure of issues and proposals governing the inquiry at hand. The POI places constraints on appropriate future moves; in order to be relevant, they must fit into the plan in some way.</span> entirely. What we need is an expansion of the structure involved in such plans to include conjecture/correction congruence in addition to question/answer congruence. Focus, fundamentally, serves to indicate information structure, but information structure includes much more than just what is given and new. It incorporates a record of where the inquiry has been as well as where it is going.</p>

<h2 id="correction-as-downdate">Correction as downdate</h2>

<p>Equally salient in the <a href="#bears">Bears</a> dialogue is the disputative nature of the response statement. It seems to simultaneously <em>deny</em> the original statement and <em>substitute</em> an alternative to it. Let’s call utterances with this dual function <em>corrections</em>. Jennifer Spenader and Emar Maier (<a id="spenader2009" class="ref tooled" href="#ref-spenader2009"><span class="date"><span class="year">2009</span></span></a>), expanding on work of Maier and Bart Geurts (<a id="geurts1998a" class="ref tooled" href="#ref-geurts1998a"><span class="date"><span class="year">1998</span></span></a>) (,geurtsa), attempt to treat corrections as <em>downdating</em> the information state. On this proposal, the function of corrections is to remove from the discourse representation something that was previous added to it. A wrinkle is that corrections do not eliminate information wholesale. Consider, fo example:</p>

<div class="def" id="movie-ex"><div class="title"><span class="head">Example 2&nbsp;</span><span>(Movie)</span></div><div class="body fence">
<div class="example"><div class="item"><span class="name">A: </span><span class="content">The movie was funny.</span></div><div class="item"><span class="name">B': </span><span class="content">The movie wasn't [funny]<sub>f</sub>, it was [hilarious]<sub>f</sub>.</span></div><div class="item"><span class="name">B'': </span><span class="content">[The]<sub>f</sub> movie wasn't funny, they [all]<sub>f</sub> were.</span></div><div class="item"><span class="name">B''': </span><span class="content">The [movie]<sub>f</sub> wasn't funny, the [film]<sub>f</sub> was.</span></div></div>
</div></div>
<div id="movie-show-tip" class="tooltip defn"><b style="border-bottom: 1px solid #fff;">Movie</b><br />
  <div class="example"><div class="item"><span class="name">A: </span><span class="content">The movie was funny.</span></div><div class="item"><span class="name">B': </span><span class="content">The movie wasn't [funny]<sub>f</sub>, it was [hilarious]<sub>f</sub>.</span></div><div class="item"><span class="name">B'': </span><span class="content">[The]<sub>f</sub> movie wasn't funny, they [all]<sub>f</sub> were.</span></div><div class="item"><span class="name">B''': </span><span class="content">The [movie]<sub>f</sub> wasn't funny, the [film]<sub>f</sub> was.</span></div></div>
</div>

<p>Crucially, the correction above does not eliminate the information that the movie was funny. In fact, the replacement is perfectly compatible with this information. What the correction denies is the presupposition of the initial statement that the moview was <em>merely</em> funny. To account for the nuanced nature of corrections, Spendader and Maier develop their proposal within the framework of Layered Discourse Representation Theory (LDRT), in which information states are segmented and different information contributed to discourse is tagged and placed in different segments depending on its import. Corrections can eliminate information from one segment without affecting the information in any other segment.</p>

<p>The challenge is to track information across utterance boundaries. LDRT allows for a single bit of information to be added to multiple segments, but when corrections take place at a remove from the utterance they correct, the proposal runs into a <em>binding problem</em>. This problem is, I think, undermining, and it reveals an inherent limitation of the LDRT account. LDRT treats utterances as providing independent contributions to the discourse either in the form of updates or downdates. But the <a href="#bears">Bears</a> dialogue is not just a pair of independent utterances. They cohere in an important way that should be accounted for in any representation of the discourse.</p>

<h2 id="collaborative-update-semantics">Collaborative update semantics</h2>

<p>If we treat the <a href="#bears">Bears</a> dialogue as a minimal example of collaborative discourse, we can capture the forward-looking import of corrections while representing the strong coherence of the utterances in the dilogue.</p>

<p>According to collaborative update semantics, the first utterance in the dialogue initiates a contribution that is completed by the second, correcting utterance. Focus is treated as a sandboxing marker and denial serves to replace the default saturation of the propositional radical with an alternative one.</p>
