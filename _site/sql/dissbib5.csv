Given the underlying type logic, compositionality at sub-clausal level follows automatically and standard techniques from Montague semantics become available.","",null,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","brasoveanua"

In the model we propose, the speaker initiates the process by presenting or inviting a noun phrase. Before going on to the next contribution, the participants, if necessary, repair, expand on, or replace the noun phrase in an iterative process until they reach a version they mutually accept. In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced. The model follows, we suggest, from the mutual responsibility that participants in conversation bear toward the understanding of each utterance.","Cognition","1986","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1-39","","22","","","https://app.box.com/s/j1e1sam0qzj5gila6b5lrxl9w7heyms0","clark1986"

Anyone who is inclined to relativise truth to more than just worlds and times faces a problem about assertion. It's easy to be puzzled about just what purpose would be served by assertions of this kind, and how to understand what we d be up to in our use of sentences like 'the treasure might be under the palm tree', if they have such peculiar truth conditions. After providing a very quick argument to motivate a relativist view of epistemic modals, I bring out and attempt to resolve this problem in making sense of the role of assertions with relativist truth conditions.","Philosophical Studies","2007","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","1-22","","133","","","https://app.box.com/s/iuee3fw6ppj2bb3oirle4w36wyx3c8vj","egan2007a"

It is widely agreed that the simple theory will not work in some cases, but the counterexamples produced so far seem amenable to a more complicated contextualist theory. We argue, however, that no contextualist theory can capture the evaluations speakers naturally make of sentences containing epistemic modals. If we want to respect these evaluations, our best option is a relativist theory of epistemic modals. On a relativist theory, an utterance of a might be F can be true relative to one context of evaluation and false relative to another. We argue that such a theory does better than any rival approach at capturing all the behaviour of epistemic modals.","","2005","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","","131-70","","","","","https://app.box.com/s/eoulvw509q5bi8iot2nmyue0fxjn4bxq","egan2005a"

It is well-known that reference markers are not like first order variables. Indeed, it is the received view that reference markers are like the variables in imperative programming languages. However, in a computational semantics of discourse that treats reference markers as dynamically bound	extquoteright variables, every noun phrase will get linked to a dynamic variable, so it will give rise to a marker index. Where do these indices come from? How do we handle them when combining or merging pieces of discourse? We will argue that reference markers are better treated as indices into context, and we will present a theory of context and context extension based on this view. In context semantics, noun phrases do not come with indices, so the merge problem does not arise. This solves a vexing issue with coordination that causes trouble for all current versions of compositional discourse representation theory.","","2003","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eijck"

I outline the main problems that arise in the interplay between presuppositions and anaphors on the one hand and attitude reports on the other Section 1.2, and discuss Heim s theory of presuppositions in attitude contexts Section 1.3 .In the second part of the paper I present my own proposal. To begin with, I define an extension of DRT in which attitude reports can be represented Sections 2.1-2.2 . I then argue that the verb believe triggers a certain presupposition and that, given the binding theory, this presupposition determines the projection behaviour of the verb Section 2.3.

It demonstrats that the attentional state properties modelled by centering can account fo these differences.","","1995","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://app.box.com/s/zxme3mt53vqp15qogrj2y4eyw8masxd2","grosz1995"

In situation semantics, linguistic expressions are evaluated with respect to partial, rather than complete, worlds. There is no consensus about what situations are, just as there is no consensus about what possible worlds or events are. According to some, situations are structured entities consisting of relations and individuals standing in those relations. According to others, situations are particulars. In spite of unresolved foundational issues, the partiality provided by situation semantics has led to some genuinely new approaches to a variety of phenomena in natural language semantics. In the way of illustration, this article includes relatively detailed overviews of a few selected areas where situation semantics has been successful: implicit quantifier domain restrictions, donkey pronouns, and exhaustive interpretations. It moreover addresses the question of how Davidsonian event semantics can be embedded in a semantics based on situations. Other areas where a situation semantics perspective has led to progress include attitude ascriptions, questions, tense, aspect, nominalizations, implicit arguments, point of view, counterfactual conditionals, and discourse relations.","","2008","","","","","Edward N.

If the BPR was true, no more would have to be said about the meaning of focus. The behavior of whatever inferences are generated by backgrounding could be taken care of by theories dealing with the projection of presuppositions of the familiar kind, the presuppositions of definite descriptions, clefts, or factives, for example. This is a non-trivial and interesting claim.","Theoretical Linguistics","2004","","","","","","","","language","","","","","","","","","123-36","","30","","","https://app.box.com/s/xojqxgi7uaw4resdx83v0ky1qh11acsc","kratzer2004"

I give preliminary definitions of the meaning of these words which are formulated in terms of logical consequence and compatibility, respectively. The second part discusses one kind of insufficiency in the meaning definitions given in the first part, which arise from the ex falso quodlibet paradox of logical consequence. In stepwise fashion, I make an attempt to avoid most of the consequences of this paradox for the meaning definitions of must and can.","Linguistics and Philosophy","1977","","","","","","","","language","","","","","","","","3","337-55","","1","","","https://app.box.com/s/ujo6mdn6rkjmb20rgb0ttrunrwgze2m0","kratzer1977"

First, we capture an analogy between presuppositions, anaphora and scope ambiguity (cf. van der Sandt 1992), by utilizing semantic under-specification (c£ Reyle 1993). Second, resolving this underspecification requires reasoning about how the presupposition is rhetorically connected to the discourse context.This has several consequences. First, since pragmatic information plays a role in computing the rhetorical relation, it also constrains the interpretation of presuppositions. Our account therefore provides a formal framework for analysing problematic data, which require pragmatic reasoning. Second, binding presuppositions to the context via rhetorical links replaces accommodating them, in the sense of adding them to the context (cf. Lewis 1979). The treatment of presupposition is thus generalized and integrated into the discourse update procedure.We formalize this approach in SDRT (Asher 1993; Lascarides & Asher 1993), and demonstrate that it provides a rich framework for interpreting presuppositions, where semantic and pragmatic constraints are integrated.","Journal of Semantics","1998","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","239-300","","15","","","","asher1998"

Next, the meanings of distribu- tivity markers such as each and non-distributivity indicators such as together are considered. An existing analysis of each in terms of quantification over parts of a plurality is adopted. However, together is problematic, for it involves a cancellation or negation of the quantification associated with each. (The four boys together owned exactly three cars could not be true if each of the boys owned three cars, though the same sentence without together could be.) A refinement of this idea of negated quantification over parts is proposed as an analysis for non-distributivity operators. It is then worked out in the system described in Cooper (1983), in which positive and negative extensions are assigned. Presuppositions connected with plural refer- ence are considered at this point as well. Finally, the cumulativity operator is argued to be quantificational and therefore sensitive to contextual domain selection. This context sensitivity is claimed to be the source of distributive readings that appear in the absence of modifiers like each and non-distributive or collective readings that arise without together.","Natural Language Semantics","1994","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Kluwer Academic Publishers","","","201-248","","2","","","https://app.box.com/s/wdjo7jxrpdrgt3jistzk0i327y4166d2","schwarzschild1994"

The context of a conversation is represented by a body of information that is presumed to be shared by the participants in the conversation -the information that the speaker presupposes a point at which a speech act is interpreted. This notion is designed to represent both the information on which context-dependent speech acts depend, and the situation that speech acts are designed to affect, and so to be a representation of context that is appropriate for explaining the interaction of context and the contents expressed in them. After reviewing the motivating ideas and the outlines of the apparatus, the paper responds to a criticism of the framework, and considers the way it can help to clarify some phenomena concerning pronouns with indefinite antecedents.","Journal of Logic, Language and Information","1998","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Netherlands","","1","3-19","","7","","","","stalnaker1998c"

Thomason and Matthew Stone and David DeVault","","","","","","","unpublished","We relate the theory of presupposition accommodation to a computational framework for reasoning in conversation. We understand presuppositions as private commitments the speaker makes in using an utterance but expects the listener to recognize based on mutual information. On this understanding, the conversation can move forward not just through the positive effects of interlocutors	extquoteright utterances but also from the retrospective insight interlocutors gain about one anothers	extquoteright mental states from observing what they do. Our title, ENLIGHTENED UPDATE, highlights such cases. Our approach fleshes out two key principles: that interpretation is a form of intention recognition; and that intentions are complex informational structures, which specify commitments to conditions and to outcomes as well as to actions. We present a formalization and implementation of these principles for a simple conversational agent, and draw on this case study to argue that pragmatic reasoning is holistic in character, continuous with common-sense reasoning about collaborative activities, and most effectively characterized by associating specific, reliable interpretive constraints directly with grammatical forms. In showing how to make such claims precise and to develop theories that respect them, we illustrate the general place of computation in the cognitive science of language.","","n/a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://app.box.com/s/1ij581mylhax7m5but72l06dttvkr6xf","thomason"
