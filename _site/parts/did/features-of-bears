    <p>There are two salient linguistic features of the <em>Bears</em> dialogue to which I would like to draw attention: utterance A has a <em>bare plural</em> subject and utterance B involves <em>focus</em> within its subject. There is a standard treatment for each of these features. In this section, I briefly outline the standard treatments.</p>

<h2 id="bare-plurals">Bare plurals</h2>

<p>Bare plural subjects can have different functions in different linguistic contexts. Though they have identical surface form, the subject in each of the following examples plays a very different role.</p>

<!-- Bear plurals -->

<div id="bear-plurals-show-tip" class="tooltip defn"><b style="border-bottom: 1px solid #fff;">Bear Plurals</b><br />
  <div class="example"><div class="item"><span class="name">A: </span><span class="content">Bears are in the field.</span></div><div class="item"><span class="name">B: </span><span class="content">Bears are mammals.</span></div><div class="item"><span class="name">C: </span><span class="content">Bears are widespread.</span></div></div>
</div>

<p>In <strong>A</strong>, the subject is a specific group of particular bears. In this guise, the bare plural is <em>existential</em>. In <strong>B</strong>, we are generalizing over the entire class of bears; thus, the subject is being employed in its <em>characterizing</em> guise. And finally, in <strong>C</strong>, we are referring directly to a <em>kind</em> and attributing a property to it.</p>

<p>The guise that is relevant for our topic dialogue is the characterizing use, and that is what our discussion will focus on here. The standard view of the logical form of sentences with generic bare plural subjects treats them as having an implicit two-place quantifier (<em>GEN</em>) with the subject as restrictor and the predicate as scope.</p>

<p>Under this analysis, there are three main questions that must be answered:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the nature of <em>GEN</em>?</li>
  <li>What is the domain of quantification?</li>
  <li>What the relationship of the restrictor class to the subject class?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="domain">Domain</h3>

<p>As a species of adverbial quantification, the domain of GEN is typically taken to be a set of cases (situations or worlds).</p>

<h3 id="normalcy">Normalcy</h3>

<p>Generics can absorb counterexamples, and sometimes quite a few. So, GEN is distinctly not a universal quantifier. A standard proposal is that GEN requires that the predicate hold in all normal cases relative to the subject. That is, the restrictor has two functions: it pares down the set of cases that are relevant to the quantification and it determines a normalcy condition on the restricted class. This effectively partitions the restricted class into preferred and dispreferred groups. The generic will be true just in case all predicate cases are in the preferred group. So construed, GEN is really a universal quantifier; it is merely one that relativized to a sub-class of the domain cases.</p>

<p><strong>My proposal provides an implementation of this structural quantification view</strong></p>

<h2 id="characterizing-generics">Characterizing generics</h2>

<p>Characterizing generics are doubly slippery: their force is amorphous and they are both susceptible and resilient.</p>

<p>It’s common to talk of <em>GEN</em> as an operator with less than universal force. But this isn’t quite accurate. Really, it is a universal quantifier over a (contextually) restricted sub-class of the subject.</p>

<p>Where, then, do we locate the preference ranking function? It could be indexically supplied or is could involve an index shift. By making it a context shifting mechanism, we can better capture susceptibility and resilience, which are results of collaborative mechanisms.</p>

<p>So, generics are structural universals. The structure is supplied by the focus alternative set. But it is supplied in a collaborative, delayed way.</p>
