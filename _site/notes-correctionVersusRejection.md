Correction is of a piece with rejection, in that it is a tool for keeping certain bits of information out of the information state. The key difference between correction and rejection is that correction is *non-swamping*. It is a fine-grained way of responding to a questionable utterance. 

I contend that this fine-grain is a crucial thing to capture, and that a standard model of discourse development that recognizes only assertion-type moves cannot adequately capture the nuance. But it also matters how you go about capturing nuance; make the divisions between bits of information too wide, and you give up the game from the start. Utterances are complex, but not easily factorizable.

But before we get into the challenges faced by other approaches, let's consider two models for keeping information that has been presented out of an information set. The models differ based on the role that the hearer is playing in the conversation: 

**Interlocutor as gate-keeper**: On this model, the hearer stops information from entering the information state in the first place. Newly uttered sentences serve to *propose* additions to the information state, but the proposal must first gain admittance from the interlocutor.

**Interlocutor as executioner**: On this model, the hearer has the authority to unilaterally remove information from the information state after it has been assimilated.

> Making the standard assumption that speakers and hearers maintain some type of discourse representation that
keeps track of what has been said in the current discourse, with each subsequent utterance, this representation is either incremented with new information (update), or already represented information is modified (downdate). With this background in mind, a denial and its associated effects on a dynamic semantic representation of a common ground can be analyzed as having three steps:

> **issue:**      the common ground representation is incremented with the first speaker’s utterance.
  **concession:** the second speaker optionally concedes that part of the informational content conveyed (or 
                  suggested) by the first speaker’s utterance is true and this information is added to the 
                  representation as well.
  **correction:** the actual denial, usually consisting of some negative particle or a negated echo of the 
                  utterance to be corrected, or if there was a concession, a but or however, etc. Normal update 
                  with the correction’s content would result in an inconsistent representation, so we apply 
                  a downdate, throwing out as much of the earlier information as needed to restore consistency. The 
                  informational content of the correction (apart from any echoes, which make no semantic 
                  contribution) and of the concession always remain untouched by the downdate.
