Spenader and Maier's approach acknowledges the discourse structural relations of concession and denial (antithesis), but they reduce the influence of these relations to determining the conditions to be added to the DRS.

But Kehler's insight is relevant here:
  
> Interpretation continues beyond this [semantic understanding], however, as the hearer is further inclined to assume unstated information necessary to analyze the passage as coherent. Indeed, examples (15)–(17) show that the need to establish coherence is a central facet of discourse understanding – just as hearers attempt to recover the implicit syntactic relations among a string of words in computing sentence meaning, they attempt to recover the implicit coherence relations among a series of sentences in computing discourse meaning.
     
> Given the centrality of coherence resolution processes to interpretation, it would be unsurprising if they were found to affect the distribution of linguistic phenomena that apply interclausally, including VP-ellipsis. Indeed, it is the thesis of this paper that this is the case.

Coherence intepretation proceeds as such:
  
> The coherence of the passage must also be established. To do this, the correct arguments to a coherence relation are first identified, and then the constraints associated with that relation are applied to them. For Cause-Effect relations, these arguments are simply the semantics for each utterance, and thus anaphoric resolution of the VP provides all the
information necessary to compute coherence. In the case of Resemblance relations, however, the more complex process of identifying parallel arguments and their relative pairings attempts to utilize the syntactic structure of the utterances. Thus, in addition to signaling that the semantics of the VP is recoverable, elision in this context can be seen as signaling that the syntactic parallelisms necessary for computing coherence are also recoverable. In effect, this imposes two requirements: (i) that the source and target VP meanings are parallel, and (ii) that any additional syntactic structure necessary for identifying further parallelism is recoverable.

Hobbs et al (p. 3) outline a measure of assumption making when derivations are not available. The measure is based on various costs associated with a particular assumption. Compare this mechanism to the Grice-Stalnaker approach in which simple semantics is undergirded by reliance on general rules of rational interpretation. My claim is that resolution of a correction structure relation is low cost when integrated into a theory of discourse in which agents are collaborative investigators. It is a secondary claim that resolving to this coherence relation (which is based on certain syntactic/phonetic clues) determines syntactic relations with semantic import. That is, recognizing that a bit of discourse is corrective imposes a structure on an utterance that it wouldn't necessarily have in isolation.
