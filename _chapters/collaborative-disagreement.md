## Contextualism and relativism

In one sense, Brisco and Green's disagree in their beliefs. Brisco thinks it was the guy in room A that did it, while Green thinks it was the one in room B, and the person who did it acted alone. In another sense, they agree in what they believe.  Belief is functionally tied to action, and Brisco and Green are acting in very similar ways.

The fact that sameness of belief is two sided in this way is brought out in the differences between a relativist and a contextualist approach to the attitudes. Relativists take belief to be a relation to a property; one that a person stands in when she self-ascribes that property. The agreement between Brisco and Green comes from their both self-ascribing the property of *currently interrogating the culprit*. Their disagreement comes from the fact that Brisco self-ascribes the property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room A* and Green self-ascribes the incompatible property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room B*.

The contextualist views the situation differently. Belief, for the contextualist, is a relation between an individual and a proposition. But propositions have parts, and belief need not be stable across changes in the parts of propositions. But context infects the relation as well, and one's relation to a proposition need not be stable across changes in context. So, Brisco and Green definitely disagree.  Hold the context fixed, and Brisco stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room A*, while Green stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room B*. Since individual people don't co-locate, these relations cannot both represent reality. But, it may yet *appear* that they agree. After all, both Brisco and Green would honestly tell the Liutenant ``I'm subjecting the culprit to interrogation''. But the contextualist denies that honest reporting tells the whole story, for our words build context in, and the belief relation extracts it.

Disagreement has been a bit of a star figure in recent debates in the philosophy of language. Primarily, it has been used as a tool for assessing the adequacy of different proposals for the semantic contribution of certain expressions. The contestants in battle disagreement are <i>absolutism</i>, <i>contextualism</i>, and <i>relativism</i>, and the standard scorecard has absolutism and relativism coming out on top in virtue of their ability to secure constant content across uses of the expression. Genuine disagreement does seem to require something toward which utterances can entail incompatible commitments, but semantic content is not the only contribution an utterance makes to discourse. Contextualism can appeal other elements of utterances, which may both remain constant and serve as the seat of disagreement.

The difference between contextualism and relativism is generally couched in terms of content, but content is not the only semantically relevant element of linguistic utterances. Also associated with what we say is a context change potential. A different way of representing the difference between contextualism and relativism is not in terms of what they mean but what they do.

If Brisco and Green both believe that they've got the culprit, then they will act in similar ways. They'll look to elicit a confession, offer up bargains, or threaten physical violence. But if Brisco's suspect is in confession room A while Green's is in B, then their actions will have quite different import. Contextualism aligns with absolutism in taking belief to be a relation between a subject and a proposition; a relation that holds just in case the subject takes the proposition to accurately represent the world she inhabits.	Relativism differs in taking belief to be a relation between a subject and a property; a relation that holds just in case the subject self-ascribes the property. (Perhaps not all relativists would be happy with this characterization, taking belief to be a three-place relation among a subject, proposition, and a perspective. But a perspectival proposition is itself a relation; curry that relation and you're left with a property.)

## Question/answer congruence

The star bit of data that is marshalled in support of this proposal is that of question/answer congruence. Compare the responses to the following question:

{% include ex.html sent='Who ate the last cookie?' sub='[Caitlin]<sub>f</sub> ate the last cookie,Caitlin ate the last [cookie]<sub>f</sub>' %} 

While response (i) is a perfectly natural answer, the placement of focus in (ii) makes it stand out as unacceptable.  Following [hamblin1958], a (suitably contextually constrained) semantic value for question A might be:

(A') {_Albert ate the last cookie_, _Betsy ate the last cookie_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

And, the proposed analysis of focus renders the following focus semantic values for the given responses:

a. {_Albert ate the last cookie_, _Betsy ate the last cookie_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

b. {_Caitlin ate the last apple_, _Caitlin ate the last beet_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

The alternative set generated by the focus in (i) is the same as the semantic value for question A, and that generated by the focus in (ii) is not.  Add in the proposed felicity condition, and you have a great explanation of question/answer congruence.

## The problem of contrastive topic

Analyzing focus interpretation in terms of a pragmatic rule connecting focus semantic values to semantic antecedents in prior discourse is incredibly fruitful. But now consider the following example:

{% include ex.html sent='What did people bring to the picinic?' sub='The [children]<sub>cf</sub> brought [unbridled enthusiasm]<sub>f</sub>' %}

This response involves two focused elements. For both elements, it is easy enough to generate the requisite alternative sets, and alternative set generated for the second focused element (marked with a subscripted *f*), is perfectly congruent with the preceding question. But a difficulty arises when we attempt to apply the felicity condition to the element labeled with *cf* (for *contrastive focus*). Its alternative set is distinctly not congruent with the preceding question, so we would expect the entire utterance to be marked as infelicitous.

Daniel Buring [buering2003] has supplied us with a technique to locate the requisite antecedent.  Building on the notion of the question under discussion developed by Cragie Roberts [roberts1998], Buring posits the existence of a *discourse tree*, which provides structure for the inquiry being undertaken. Each question governing the inqury is a node in the tree and is associated with an array of subquestions, complete answers to which constitute partial answers to the parent question.  The idea is that the subquestions provide a _plan of inquiry_ for addressing the parent question. The objective of the inquiry is to answer the top-most question in the tree. The plan for doing so is to answer each of the subquestions in turn.

But how should we apply this porposal to the current case, where contrastive focus is present without any explicit question? We can, of course, appeal again to the ever present implicit question under discussion. All discourses, it would be maintained, whether questions have been explicitly introduced or not, are governed by a plan of inquiry, which is structured by questions, implicit if need be. Then, the explanation of the contrastive topic in (@bears) would be that the original assertion offers an answer to a parent question, and the correction that follows rejects this answer, replacing it with an answer to a subquestion.

This proposal certainly fits with the structure of the question under discussion representation of the conversational scoreboard. But we may be left a little unsatisfied with the details.  First, it seems to be straining the notion of presupposition pretty heavily. Not only is there no direct representation to stand as antecedent to the generated focus semantic value, [AS WAS POINTED OUT EARLIER] contrastive topic is quite resiliant to infellicity.  Many different potential elements could have been fellicitously focused, and it's hard to see how the conversational scoreboard could have all of these options ready to hand. The common response to this sort of worry is to appeal to accommodation. If the scoreboard does not contain the d-tree needed to provide the antecedent for the contrastive focus, then straightaway it comes about. This reliance on accommodation is not without its own set of issues, predominantly stemming from the unconstrained character of accommodation as a theoretical posit.

But what I take to be the central issue with this sort of approach to the problem of contrastive topic in corrections is a conceptual one having to do with the role of corrections in discourse evolution. The question under discussion model of contrastive topic makes the discourse contribution of contrastive topic entirely backward looking. Whatever role the focus plays is just a matter of checking prior discourse for an antecedent to the focus generated alternative set.
