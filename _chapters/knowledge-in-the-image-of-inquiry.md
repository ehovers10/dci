abstract: 
  It is commonly held that knowledge is the end of inquiry, but if we take this connection seriously, there are significant implications for our understanding of the nature of knowledge. I propose to take at face value the idea that knowledge is whatever we get as output in the process of inquiry. Delving into the nature of inquiry reveals that it is a <em>collaborative</em> endeavor, and so, then is knowledge. This idea has important consequences for explaining the distinctive value of knowledge over true belief and for the contextualism/relativism debate in epistemology.

## Knowledge as the end of inquiry

Inquiry is, according to Robert Stalnaker {% include ref.html id="stalnaker1987" o="" e="," %} "the enterprise of forming, testing, and revising beliefs". This is a goal-directed enterprise. Both the impetus for engaging in inquiry and the procedure of doing so are understood in terms of their contribution to the achievement of some end. 

It is tempting to maintain that the {% include concept.html word='end of inquiry' %} is truth. While possession of the truth may be what the inquirer is after, she wishes to possess it in such a way that she both *recognizes* and *accepts* it as the truth. The goal of engaging in inquiry is to achieve a specific *cognitive* state with true propositions as its content.

In contrast, C.S. Peirce and others following in his wake {% include ref.html id="levi1980" o="n" e="," %} have suggested that truth is too lofty a goal, that the most we can genuinely hope for at the end of inquiry is the *settlement of opinion*, for:
  
> "it is clear that nothing out of the sphere of our knowlege can be our object, for nothing which does not affect the mind can be the motive for mental effort. The most that can be maintained is, that we seek for a belief that we shall *think* to be true. But we think each one of our beliefs to be true, and indeed, it is mere tautology to say so." {% include ref.html id="peirce1877" o="n" e="" p="11" %}
    
In response, we could take the pragmatist bait and insist that truth is the end of inquiry simply because whatever is output from the process of inquiry *just is* truth. But we needn't take this line. We can cleave to a correspondence account of truth while maintaining that the final aim of inquiry involves {% include concept.html word='wide content' %} by delimiting a natural, restricted category of *proper* inquiry that can be reliably expected to produce true propositions. 

Proper inquiry is a rule governed process. Rule-following has the practical advantage of improving the reliability of the inquiry, but this is merely the icing. The principal connection to rule following is a conceptual one. The cognitive state that the inquirer seeks is a *praiseworthy* one, and one does not garner praise simply by stumbling onto true propositions. Undertaking the process of inquiry is important to earning the accolades that come with possessing the truth. 

The end of inquiry, then, is a (i) praseworthy, (ii) cognitive state with (iii) true propositions as its content. In other words, proper inquiry is a process that reliably produces justified, true belief. Modulo Gettier-type complications, the end of inquiry is *knowledge*.

The *knowledge rule of assertion* is the proposal that it is a constitutive norm of assertion that one only assert what one knows. Jonathan Schaffer {% include ref.html id="schaffer2008" o="" %} asks what comes of knowledge when we take the knowledge rule of assertion seriously. His answer is that, since assertion is best seen as taking place within a discourse context structured by the question under discussion {% include ref.html id="roberts1996" o="n" e="," %} and the *QUD* is best represented by the set of its alternative answers {% include ref.html id="groenendijk1984" o="n" e="," %} knowledge is similarly relativized to a set of alternatives to the proposition known. And this makes knowledge look a lot like Schaffer's contrastivist proposal would have it.

This proposal to limn the structure of knowledge by investigating the structure of assertion is motivated by the suggested connection between knowledge and assertion. As Timothy Williamson puts the idea, "it is pointless to ask why the knowledge rule is the rule of assertion. It could not have been otherwise" {% include ref.html id="williamson2000" o="" p="267" e="." %} Knowledge is strongly modally tied to assertion, and modal connections generally bring structural similarity in their wake. Of course, structural similarity is a symmetric relation, and it is feasible to adjust our conception of the structure of assertion to match a particular account of knowledge. But with a well developed theory of assertion in the offing, it is reasonable to let it inform our conception of knowledge.

Similarly, knowledge and inquiry are not a merely incidentally connected. Inquiry is designed with a specific eye toward producing knowledge. Even stronger, it is natural to *define* inquiry operationally as any process whose output is, *ceteris paribus*, knowledge. Properly conducted inquiry results in knowledge properly conceived. If we take this idea seriously, then the structure of knowledge ought to mirror the structure of the outputs of inquiry.[^connection]

Of course, structural similarlity is a symmetric relation; if we had a solid understanding of the nature of knowledge, we could use the *end of* connection to extend our understanding to encompass inquiry as well. But opinion on the nature of knowledge is not nearly settled. I propose to take at face value the idea that the outputs of the process of inquiry are knowledge and, thereby, to provide insight into the structure of the knowledge relation.

Inquiry, as we'll see ([Sect. 2](#the-nature-of-inquiry)), has a structure that evokes its deeply collaborative nature. By way of the *end of* connection, we have reason to represent the knowledge relation as similarly collaborative. In one sense, this idea is quite radical, in that it seems to eliminate the potential for solipsitic knowledge, and that it complicates the relationship between facts and the things that are known. But we can perhaps buff a few of the burrs off this conceptual edge ([Sect. 3](#knowledge-and-knowing)), and the proposal garners support from the puzzles it can help to solve. 

Possessing knowledge is uncontroversially more valuable than possessing merely true belief, but the basis of this judgement is more elusive. The inquiry-first account of knowledge offers a solution to the value of knowledge question ([Sect 4](#the-value-of-knowledge)). 

Intuitions about whether two discourse participants disagree with eachother have been brought forward as evidence for particular semantic theories, but the value of this evidence remains under-developed. The inquiry-first account of knowledge provides a grounding for linguistic intuitions about disagreement and speaks in favor of *relativism* as the semantic theory that best captures those intuitions ([Sect. 5](#contextualism-and-relativism)).

## The nature of inquiry

### Error avoidance

Isaac Levi {% include ref.html id="levi1980" o="" e="," %} too, thinks that we can extract information regarding the nature of knowledge from our representation of the nature of inquiry. His simple account of knowledge: "From X's point of view at *t*, there is no difference between what he fully believes at *t* and what he knows at *t*" {% include ref.html id="levi1980" o="" p="28" e="," %} stems from his account of the nature of inquiry. Truth is excised for the same reasons that Peirce relied on above, and justification, what Levi calls *pedigree*, is eliminated on the basis that information states are the inputs to inquiry and such states do not contain their historical provenance.[^pedigree]

While there is no accounting for an agent's knowledge state *at a time*, we can effectively evaluate the *transitions* their states of knowledge undergo. That is, there are norms for the *process* of proper inquiry. Inquiry involves the change of bodies of belief, and the criterion for appropriate such changes is care taken against importing error into one's belief corpus. For Levi, the aim of inquiry is *error-avoidance* {% include ref.html id="levi1980" o="" p="71" e="." %}

In epistemic logic, an information state (&#x1d472;) is represented by a deductively closed set (&#x1d43e;) of interpreted sentences of some language (&#x1d50f;). This is the syntactic standpoint on information states. We can equivalently represent them semantically by assuming a domain of points representing maximal, consistent sets of sentences of &#x1d50f;, and treating each &#x1d43e; as an equivalence class of such points relative to the agent's beliefs. In this way, an agent's information state is their "standard for serious possibility" {% include ref.html id="levi1980" o="n" p="8" e="," %} represented as a set of possible worlds amongst which their knowledge does not decide.

The epistemologist's primary responsibility is to provide criteria for changes that *improve* one's information state from those that make it no better. Only the former are motivated, and justification must be provided to demonstrate that a change is in that category. Let's call any change made to an information state a *revision*. Given the structure of information states as Levi understands them, all revisions are represented by set theoretic operations. The two principle such operations are set intersection, which (on the semantic conception) represents an *expansion* of one's knowledge -- acquiring information involves eliminating worlds from one's consideration as a genuine possibility; and set union, which represents *contraction* -- withdrawing belief and thereby becoming uncertain about some proposition involves adding worlds to one's set of considered possibilities. According to Levi, and what has become known as the *Levi Identity*, all revisions are reducible to some combination of *expansion* and *contraction*.

The problem of justification, then, is to specify the properties of the expansion and contraction operators such that all warranted changes in belief are subsumed under their operation. For Levi, knowledge is both the beginning and end of inquiry, and the process of inquiry is transition between such states, characterized by principles of appropriate expansion and contraction.

Expansion is the easier of the two operations to understand. Syntactically, the operation involves adding a sentence to the information state and taking the deductive closure of the result. Semantically, this is just the intersection of the state of information with the state representing the expansion proposition. Given the deductive closure constraint on information states, there is only one viable expansion operation. 

There is more room for nuance in specifying the contraction operation, for there is more than one way to remove information from the information state.[^agm] Rationality does not determine a unique operation on one's state of information in response to removing a belief from consideration. For any instance of contraction, there will be potential belief states that are incompatible but between which there is no way of determining the better and the worse. They are all equally well justified, and since they result from the process of proper inquiry, they are equally states of knowledge. 

It is thus a consequence of Levi's approach to inquiry as transition between states of knowledge following the dictates of a revision operator that there can be multiple, incompatible states of knowledge.

### Impetus to revise

For Levi, it is no part of a theory of inquiry *why* an agent chooses to undergo a revision in their information state. As each state is perfectly acceptable by its own lights, there can be no rational reason to change it. Revision does come about naturally. As Peirce puts the idea, "The iritation of doubt causes a struggle to attain a state of belief," and this iritation is "the only immediate motive for the struggle to attain belief" {% include ref.html id="peirce1877" o="" p="10" e="." %} While the iritation is natural, there is no accounting for when the agent chooses to scratch.[^whyrevise]

In *The Will to Believe*, William James {% include ref.html id="james1896" o="" %} drew a distinction between two independent and sometimes conflicting goals for those engaged in the pursuit of knowledge. One is, as Levi suggests, to avoid believing falsehoods, but another, equally important one, is to acquire true beliefs.  A clever agent could meet the goal of avoiding falsehoods by simply believing nothing at all, but they would thereby forfeit the virtue of believing truths. One could, alternatively, meet the goal of believing truths simply by believing everything, but doing so sacrifices entirely achieving the second goal. As James saw it, a strategy of inquiry that floats between these extremes is the path we ought to search for. This suggests that the need for revision is not merely an incidental consequence of our inquisitive minds. It is, instead, an ocassional mandate of proper inquiry that the agent *strive* to believe truths, even if doing so risks importing error.

James famously argued that if one's belief choice is *live*, *momentous*, and *forced*, then the will to believe rationally outstrips the fear of being wrong. But as a set of necessary requirements, this restricts speculative endeavors too much. Inquiry need not be momentous or forced for a jump to a conclusion to be fruitful. Mere time-sensitivity may be enough.

James' model makes inquiry an optimization task between taking on too many falsehoods and leaving out too many truths.  And it is a task that is undertaken by fallible individuals in real time.  Such agents have limited access to information and limited resources to dedicate to the process of inquiry. Frequently, action is required when certainty cannot be obtained. And on many quotidian decision points, the risk of being incorrect is fairly low. It is *because* not every inquiry is momentous that striving for truth (and risking falsehood) is sometimes to be prefered. 


This is perhaps fine with Levi, whose stated view of inquiry is as a means to error avoidance. If one never revises, one never risks importing error. And if one must revise, then do so by the precepts of expansion and contraction. 

But this is where Levi parts ways with Peirce. Levi's rational inquirer can be content to maintain a static belief state, for he knows the only potential criticism comes when he decides to revise. Of course, revision may be forced upon him by quotidian interaction with the world. One's belief state is constantly updated involuntarily by way of one's perceptual input. These updates require maintenance using the same principles of revision. But there is no mechanism, in Levi's system, for initiating inquiry. 

Peirce, on the other hand, and William James following him, ackowledge that error avoidance is only one epistemic duty. There is, in addition, a drive to acquire truth, inspired by what Peirce calls "the irritation of doubt" (*The Fixation of Belief*, p. 10). To take this stance is to hold that no information state, aside from those of complete information (and maybe not even those, if we heed Mill's edicts on expressive freedom), is stable; there is always a call for revision.

To accommodate this idea, we need to represent both *information state inadequacy* and the *impetus for revision of inadequate states*. To have a call for revision of one's information state is to recognize an inadequacy therein. 

Levi grants that striving for truth can play a role in inquiry. He suggests that an inquirer *X* 

> "should be concerned not merely to avoid error but to acquire new information. The promise of obtaining new information may sometimes (though not always) compensate *X*, from his initial point of view, for the risk to be incurred" (1980 p.35).

Lip service is certainly being paid to the goal of acquiring truths, but this goal is given second class standing when it comes to the structure of inquiry. Levi draws a distinction between what he calls *equilibrium conditions* on rationality, which represent commitments that an agent acquires as a basis of logic given that they possess a particular belief corpus; and commitments that the individual bears in virtue of her cognitive goals. The commitment to believing *p &amp; q* when you believe *p* and believe *q* qualifies as an equilibrium condition. But the commitment to maintaining a consistent belief corpus does not. Levi sees no reason to deny the inconsistent information state status as a viable state. But he agrees that one would be well advised both to revise away from it when one finds oneself in that state and also to avoid revising into it when one is considering a transition. The difference is that this advice stems from the *goal* of inquiry as avoiding error. The inconsistent state is guaranteed to contain error; in so far as one is motivated by the goal of inquiry, one ought to be motivated to avoid it.

The implication is that while equilibrium conditions receive direct representation in the inquiry structure, by way of the deductive closure constraint on viable information states and the properties of the revision operator, mere cognitive goal-generated constraints do not.

I don't see a non-question begging motivation for this distinction. It is true that equilibrium conditions are directly represented in Levi's characterization of inquiry by way of the rules on the revision operator, whereas commitments generated from an agents cognitive goals are not so represented. But the question of how to represent inquiry is the very topic of investigation, and principles of consistency, for instance, seem antecedently as central to proper inquiry as conjunctive syllogism. 

Perhaps equilibrium conditions are to be understood as invoking isolated adjustments to a portion of an information state, whereas cognitive goal generated commitments are holistic in that they make essential reference to an information state as a whole. Even if this distinction can be upheld, it does not carry the weight needed to exclude cognitive goal commitments from representation in the structure of inqury. Inquiry is a complex and dilated process, and it is intended to be a topic-neutral characterization of knowledge incrementation. As such, there is nothing precluding inquiry from being self-referential. We may even find that that there are gains in efficiency to be had by being able to reference entire information states in the course of inquiry.

Nor is the atomic/holistic distinction adhered to in Levi's explicit position on inquiry. He thinks it is a fault of other discussions of inquiry that they treat revisions as adding or subtracting individual belief from a corpus. Instead, for Levi, revision does not take place by adding or subtracting single sentences from a corpus, it is always a "set of sentences of propositions added to a corpus to make a deductively closed set" (p.27).

Levi worries that the goal of truth acquisition is topic-specific while the goal of error avoidance is universal. Perhaps we could motivate the distinction as one of topic-neutrality. The inquiry structure is meant to have universal application, but if there is no universal way to represent the goal of truth acquisition, then it is not a structural element of inquiry. Levi is right that the particular demands of acquiring truth will depend on the topic of investigation, but so too do the demands of error avoidance. What matters is whether we can introduce structural elements to model the process of truth acquisition, just as the revision operator models the process of error avoidance. If a theoretically virtuous (simple, unifying, productive) model can be provided, there seems to be no principled reason of barring the antecedently motivated goal of truth acquisition from the inquiry representation.

We ought to let the demands of empirical coverage guide our thoeretical posits. I take it that conversation realizes inquiry, and as such analysis of the distribution of expressions in conversation bears on the nature of inquiry. If our best theories of particular lingusitic expressions reference semantic structures that walk and quack like cognitive goal-generated commitments, then inquiry ought to accommodate them. Such expressions are waddling all over the place:
  
+ Modals
+ Evidentials
+ Speach acts
+ Conditionals

Inadequacies can be of the sort in which a state contains too much information; that is, it involves a contradiction.[^1] Revision of this sort of inadequacy is accommodated on the Levi model. While all information states are, for Levi, equal in terms of adequacy, we can set the trivial state aside as the one state that always demands revision, and in particular, revision by contraction out of epistemic hell. 

Inadequacies can also arise when one acknowledges that their information state contains too little information; that is, one becomes aware of an issue that is not settled by their state of information. This sort of inadequacy is not to be accommodated in Levi's model. Primarily, all non-trival information states are equivalently adequate. But additionally, all states of information are is their members, and there is no means of ranking states based on their membership.[^2] Each state contains infinitely many points. Aside from the situation in which one state strictly contains another, there is no way of saying that one state is more informative than another. Even in the case of containment, having more information does not necessarily make the state more desirable. The more informative state involves one way of expanding from the less informative one. But independent of knowledge of the *alternative* expansions, there is no saying that such an expansion ought to be carried out.

For a state to represent itself as containing unsettled issues, we need to add structure to the information state. To have an unsettled issue is to have a non-uniformity across the information state with respect to a particular subject matter; certain points represent one resolution of the subject matter, other points a different resolution. 

## Plans of inquiry

*James' extension of inquiry requires corrective mechanisms to check flights of fancy*

A preference for belief in the face of uncertainty is further supported by the fact that inquiries are packaged with corrective feedback mechanisms.  An important such mechanism is the build-and-test update procedure that inquiry exhibits. Inquiries are cummulatively built in a step by step process. One contributor to the inquiry adds a proposal to the mutual inquiry workspace at which point it can be played around with by all members of the inquiry before being ultimately accepted or rejected. Collaboration makes speculation worthwhile.

Levi sees the process of inquiry as a binary relation between states of information. We can import information about the genesis of a sentence during the revision phase, and use this to determine whether a sentence deserves entry or retention in our information state. But once the revision takes place, all that information is lost. All sentences in an information state have the same infallible status. It is as if the information state was formed from whole cloth.

But once we open the door to incorporating the goal of truth acquisition into our representation of inquiry, we see inquiry as a dilated process. Inter-revision states are not complete states of knowledge. Instead, they are way stations on the road to knowledge. States are integrated such that it is possible to reference past states in our revision rules. Since the properties of the revision operator represent the diachronic justification of belief, proper revision in a dilated structure of integrated states requires respecting a *plan of inquiry*.

Plans are a form of commitment regarding future action. We understand the nature of plans in terms of the role that they play in an agent's attempts to successfully navigate the world -- their efforts at *practical reasoning*. 

In circumstances calling for action, agents are faced with choice sets, which are just the alternative actions available to the agent. The purpose of practical reasoning is to select, amongst the alternatives in a choice set, that action that best helps the agent meet their goals. In essence, practical reasoning can be represented as a function that takes a *choice set* and a *goals set* and outputs a *preference ordering* over the choice set. There may be applications in which the entire ordering is important, but in general the practical reasoning output is put to use by the agent acting on the top ranked option. 

My concern here is with the *choice set* side of the practical reasoning formula. In order to pick the preferred action from within a choice set, one must first have a means of determining its membership.

As understood here, choice sets are non-maximal sets of incompatible actions. Choice sets are restricted to incompatible elements, in the sense that the agent's choice to perform one action precludes his ability to perform any other in the set, because we want to focus only on forced choices. If the options before the agent do not preclude each other, then there is little sense to be made of the claim that the end result of any deliberation over that set is more rational than the other.

Their non-maximality is due to the cognitive and practical limitations of human actors. Perhaps ideal reasoners could engage in practical reasoning by selecting one action from amongst all possibilities full stop. But human reasoners surely do not do this, nor does it seem appropriate to contend that they ought to. The decision process takes both time and cognitive resources. If agents are to avoid paralysis, they must have a means of distributing these resources over a mere handful of options. Additionally, agents come to the decision table with certain conceptual proclivities and limitations. Certain actions that may in principle serve to achieve their goals will simply not be genuine options for them. Blindness to certain options may arise due to the agent's evolutionary and social history. We do not want to say that agents who cannot assess their prospects for action with complete accuracy are precluded from engaging in proper practical reasoning. 

I will not attempt to provide a theory of how human agents solve the problem of honing choice sets generally, but I think we can mention a couple broad categories of factors that enter into their determination. There are such factors as the evolutionary and social history of the agent. In a very real sense, our upbringing influences our decision making process both in how we assess the relative merits of the options before us and in what we take to be the genuine options. To take a familiar example, in deliberating on what to eat, my choice set may be limited to pizza or salad. The exclusion of fried salamander need not be because it is in principle unavailable as an option; it just so happens that such a consideration never even enters into the mix. And this need not indicate a failure of rationality on my part; it is simply the result of a-rational processes of choice limitation deriving from my causal heritage. 

There are similar factors in play that have less far reaching causal histories. Certain features of my circumstances may make it such that I don't percieve the viability of plausible options. Because these limitations imposed on choice sets derive from a-rational/non-cognitive features of the agent's circumstance, let's label them *saliency restrictions*. They are in essence the factors that determine a choice as a *live option* in William James' sense. 

The arational character of saliency conditions means they lack normativity. They involve evolutionarily and socially instilled blinders that guide choice restriction without appeal to rational choice by the agent. However, there is an important sense in which there are certain options that an agent *should* consider. If salience were the sole mechanism by which choice sets were determined, then agents could simplify their decision making without fault simply by responding to situations dogmatically. While it is likely that salience plays some role in the choice set determination phase, if this phase is genuinely an element of practical reason, then salience cannot be the whole story.

A second category of factors that plausibly limit the options in choice sets are more cognitive in nature. It is frequently the case that certain possibilities are simply irrelevant to the circumstances of the agent. Relevance is a tricky notion, but a suitable definition for our purposes can be adapted from the definition of p-dependence offered by John Hawthorne and Jason Stanley {% include ref.html id="hawthorne2008" o="" p="580" e=":" %}
  
> Let us say that a choice between options x1...xn is *p dependent* iff the most preferable of x1...xn conditional on the proposition that p is not the same as the most preferable of x1...xn conditional on the proposition that non-p.
Hawthorne and Stanley are concerned with the use of propositions as considerations in the process of selecting an element from a choice set, as opposed to granting initial membership in the choice set. But the insight is apt for our problem as well. The basic thought is that relevance is a matter of impacting one's circumstances. If adding an option to a choice set does not redistribute the preference ordering over the other options, then it is not a relevant option. In large part, whether performance of an action alters one's preference ordering depends on their interests, or goals, in those circumstances. Thus, in addition to performing a selective task, the goal set also ha a hand in dertermining the membersheip fo the choice set that it selects from.

An agent's interests contribute to their choice set determination by filtering out the actions that do not serve their purposes, and salience further hones the options by eliminating the possibilities that are not feasible for the agent given her background. But even after the contribution of these factors, we may be left with a relatively large array of options. What is even worse for effective decision making, agents are constantly beset with changing options. Even when we aren't being fickle about our interests, the environment constantly impinges on us in unexpected ways. To deal with this fact, rational agents form *plans*. Planning serves the project of effective decision making in a number of ways. Formost among those is its ability to provide a stable background against the ever changing environment. When we form plans, we establish certain checkpoints on the way to our goals as fixed, and we adjust our choices to align with those fixed points as much as possible.

In setting plans into action, the agent takes certain future actions to be given, thus constraining the alternatives the agent must take into consideration as time progresses. This establishes stability, which contributes to decision making success. But rigidity, in the form of overly determinate or immutable plans must be avoided. As Bratman et al. put it {% include ref.html id="bratman1988" o="" p="9-10" e=":" %}

> Given the requirement of stability, plans should also be partial. In addition to bounded computational resources, agents have bounded knowledge. They are neither prescient nor omniscient: the world may change around them in ways they are not in a position to anticipate. Hence highly detailed plans about the far future will often be of little use, the details not worth worrying about.

*Partiality* guarantees for stability by allowing the agent to fill in the details when they become pertinent. My plan to buy lunch from a sandwich shop on the way into the office fails to factor in my means of paying for lunch. If I happen to spend all my cash the night before, my decision making is not derailed because I can still stick to the plan by paying for lunch with a credit card the next morning. A level of open-endedness allows the plan to remain relatively intact even in the face of unanticipated change. Then, at the time of action, standing plans serve to filter out certain alternatives. If an alternative action is incompatible with the outline of the plan, then it is ignored. 

Thus, in combination with salience and interests, plans complete the winnowing of options required for agents to effectively use their resources in deliberation. However, the knowledge limitations that make stability so crucial also put limitations on the advisability of steadfast adherence to plans. Again, Bratman et al {% include ref.html id="bratman1988" o="" p="15" e=":" %}

> A rational agent's current plans must not have irrevocable control over her future deliberation and behavior. Rather a rational agent should sometimes be willing to reconsider her plans in light of unanticipated events. There thus exists a tension between the stability that plans must exhibit to play their role in focusing practical reasoning and the recovability that must also be inherent in them, given that they are formed on the basis of incomplete information about the future.

To accommodate revocability, agents utilize a *filter override mechanism*. In rational agents, this mechanism is sensitive enough to trigger when plans need to be reconsidered without being so sensitive as to undermine the stability that plans provide. 

Inquiry is a process of practical reasoning. The choice set is populated with propositions, and the goal set is, at least, to believe the truth. Inquiry realizes the mechanism by which the selection of a preferred proposition is made. As such, effective inquiry requires determination of the membership of the choice set. In virtue of the dilated process of rational inquiry, *plans of inquiry* are an essential element of the representation of the inquiry.

### Joint activity

*James' extension is supported by another corrective mechanism: dispute*

The success of this procedure depends heavily on a shared understanding of each party's role in the inquiry. An individual can only feel comfortable in proposing a speculative addition to the common ground if they believe that their collaborators will correct their contribution to the best of their ability.  And this requires interlocutors to be more than passive recipients of information.  They must use openings in the conversation to voice disapproval or uncertainty in addition to registering understanding and acceptance of what has been presented.

Disagreement is the tool by which interlocutors can check each other's flights of fancy.  And, I maintain, it is a tool we both know how to wield, and are prepared to let others weild against us.  The primary role of joint inquiry is to expedite what would be an extremely tedious task if attempted alone.  Even alone, the task can be sped up via judicious application of speculative intellectual leaps, though the risk involved cannot be wholly eliminated.  The collaborative facet of joint inquiry provides extra motivation for assuming the risk -- the cooperative interlocutor, to the extent she is able, will pull you back from the ledge by voicing her disagreement. 

Dilated inquiry is a collaborative effort, either between different inquirers working together, or a single inquirer working on past progress at a later time. Viable use of the inquiry over the course of time (with different contributors) requires an ability to track the changes the inquiry imposes on the information state.  That is, we need a *revision history*.

Inquiry is not a monotonic process. It moves in starts and spurts. The impetus to revise occassionaly moves the information state into a problematic position, which can only be recognized as needing remedy later on. Remedy requires revision, but there are an infinite number of ways to revise. Directed revision requires a *revision history*.

Knowledge is not, as Levi suggests, merely infallible belief. It requires inter-revision justification. Knowledge requires an account. This too is represented in inquiry (here, I'm flipping the grounding order). Inquiry carries a *revision history*, by way of treating structuring updates as relations-in-intension, instead of directly imposing the structure on the inforamtion state.

John Stuart Mill's {% include ref.html id="mill1859" o="" %} defense of liberty centrally relies on the corrective value of dispute. Even in the face of certainty regarding the answer to certain questions, dispute plays an important role. In successful inquiry, it is not enough that the participants in the inquiry come to accept truths about the world. The process of inquiry, when faithfully undertaken serves to provide its participants with justification for coming to accept the outputs of the process. Having gone through the inquiry is also necessary for the right to believe its outputs.

But this makes one's right to believe dependent upon the interlocutors with whom one interacts. Not only are asserters expected to be able to provide reasons for the propositions they propose, hearers are expected to challenge assertions when their content contradicts either their own expectations, or the shared conversational record. 

These commitments of cooperative exchange are realized in certain discourse mechanisms. The hearer has tools at her disposal for challenging assertion.  Primary among these is flat out denial, but often it is not maximally cooperative to flatly deny an assertion for this response has the effect of derailing the progress of the inquiry, and it is too sweeping in its effect.  Utterances involve a great number of parts, any of which may be subject to criticism, but criticizing one part may leave others unscathed.  Thus, hearers also have means for correcting utterances without issuing a blanket denial.

Mill's model of inquiry makes collaboration essential to the process. It is not just that individuals can make use of each other to acquire true beliefs about the world. Earning the right to those beliefs requires individuals to work together, and it foists commitments upon each party: speakers must be ready to defend their claims and hearer's must be prepared to correct claims when they can.

For Mill, it was essential to the justification of beliefs that they withstand continual attack from those who disagree with them. That is, for an individual to justifiably maintain a particular belief, they must be capable of defending that belief against attack from potential, reasonable dissenters. Even stronger, they must actually defend the belief against actual, reasonable dissenters. Marc Moffett {% include ref.html id="moffett2007" o="" %} has suggested that this criterion of individual justified belief is tantamount to what he calls the collective criticism condition, which demands "free and open critical discussion" of beliefs among epistemic peers who hold countervailing beliefs. We thus derive a principle of social epistemics from a principle of individual level justification of belief.

If the process of inquiry is what provides individual level belief justification, then the process of inquiry must make room for the collective criticism condition. It is my contention that natural discourse does just this. Not only are asserters expected to be able to provide reasons for the propositions they propose, hearers are expected to challenge assertions when their content contradicts either their own expectations, or the shared conversational record.

These commitments of cooperative exchange are realized in certain discourse mechanisms. The hearer has certain tools at her disposal for challenging assertion. Primary among these is flat out denial, but often it is not maximally cooperative to flatly deny an assertion for this response has the effect of derailing the progress of the inquiry, and it is too sweeping in its effect. Involve a great number of parts, any of which may be subject to criticism, but criticizing one part may leave others unscathed. Thus, hearers also have means for correcting utterances without issues a blanket denial.

This account of justification is an internalist one. Hearers must be aware of their commitment in securing justification for the speaker, and the speaker must be aware that the hearer is so aware in order to retain genuine warrant for her assertion. (Presumably, this mutual awareness could be iterated indefinitely.) The presence of this mutual awareness of each participant's role in generating justification suggests that not only does the hearer respond to the speaker's proposal, but also that the speaker's proposal will anticipate the hearer's response. Assertions represent, in addition to the content put forward, their anticipation of potential challenges to that content. Call this the corrective potential of an assertion.

The proposal here is that speaker and hearer contributions form a discourse pair, each of which both depends on and puts constraints on the other. A consequence of this model of discourse is that one can get insight into the deep structure of an utterance by looking to the nature of its discourse pair.

A well established application of this idea can be found in the alternative semantics for focus interpretation. It was found that focus placement in responses to questions easily predictable. And the semantic contribution of focus in an utterance matches that of the question to which the utterance is a fellicitous response.

### Advancing the inquiry

A conjecture is a kind of conversational move. It is defined in terms of the role it plays in advancing the inquiry in which it occurs. While speech acts are finely individuated, there is a small set of {% include concept.html word='contribution' %} types derivable from the goals of inqury.[^ConversationalForce] 

The primary goal of inquiry is to come to know something one did not know at its outset. Thus, an individual can advance us toward that goal by submitting (proposing) information to be taken on as mutually accepted. We call this kind of contribution an {% include concept.html word='assertion.' %}

The end point of an inquiry depends in part on its starting point, which is the *issue* that is to be resolved by the process of inquiry. An individual can submit a new issue to the inquiry to be taken on as providing a new goal for the inquiry.  We call this contribution a {% include concept.html word='question' %}.[^command][^mood]

These commonly cited examples do not provide an exhaustive list of conceptually possible contribution types. I don't intend to provide identity conditions for types of contribution, but the examples do share certain things in common, and their common traits can provide us with criteria for recognizing novel contribution types.

+ Genuine contribution types *operate on* {% include concept.html word='*information*' %} in a distinctive way. Assertions expand the context set, and questions partition it. The currency of inquiry is information, and its value is tied to the ways in which information can be put to use to advance the inquiry toward its goal. 
+ Conversational moves that contribute to inquiry *anticipate an appropriate response*, and *place constraints on the form of the response*. Assertion anticipates either acceptance or rejection of the asserted content, and (modulo repair tactics for failed presuppositions) restricts responses to either acceptance or rejection. Questions anticipate an answer, and restrict responses to those assertions that at least partially resolve the issue raised.[^QACongruence] 
+ Genuine contribution types are performed by way of a *conventionalized linguistic tool*. If a contribution belongs to a specific type, language will have found a way to implement that type. Assertions and questions are stronly tied to linguistic mood, although the connection between these contribution types and mood is a tricky one {% include ref.html id="portner1997,starr2010" o="n" e="." %}

I maintain that conjecture, when paired with a corresponding correction, constitutes a distinct, genuine contribution type. Conjecture is similar to assertion in that it seems to provide a proposal of added information. And similarly to questions, conjectures seem to present an issue that is up for further discussion.[^supposition] But conjectures are distinct from each of these, and call for a unique treatment.  That they earn such status is what I hope to show throughout the course of this project.

## Knowledge and knowing

Call the result the *inquiry-first* account of knowledge. The object of knowledge is the output of proper inquiry -- a collaborativeely developed structure composed of a possibility space, a set of relations over that space, and a record of the process by which the issue has been resolved. This is a fairly substantial departure from the standard view of knowledge on which it is a relation that holds between an individual and a proposition. But substantial doesn't mean radical, and the proposal is not as divorced from common sense as it may at first seems

### Solitary knowing

If one does not belong to a community of inquirers, then the notion of defending one's contributions makes little practical sense for the solitary inquirer, just as the notion of liberty of opinion has little practical value for the solitary opiner. Still, the hermit, and non-social animals generally, seem capable of possessing knowledge. The *Collective criticism condition* threatens to cut too much. But the inquiry-first account is doubly qualified to account for this knowledge. First, the account requires only that the knower possess the *ability* to defend her beliefs, whether or not they have come under actual threat.[^ability]

Second, the account commits the knower onyl ro defending belief against the *best available* arguments. In the degenerative case, these arguments may not be all that good. A consequence is that knowledge is relative to external factors such as the existence of an engaged community poised to challenge belief. This externalization of the conditions for knowledge is significant, but not unmotivated. Consider the classic cases of external defeaters in the post-Gettier epistemology literature. Gilbert Harman's *library detective* case will do {% include ref.html id="harman1973" o="n" e=":" %}[^goldman]
  
> In front of the library detective, Tom takes a library book from the shelf and hides it in his coat. He then walks out of the library without renting it and brazenly flaunts it outside. The library detective sees all of this and reports it to the police. The library detective is confident that it is Tom who stole the book.
> 
> Later, Tom's mother testifies that Tom has a twin brother who has a naughty streak, and Tom could not have taken the book because he is actually thousands of miles away. The library detective does not hear this testimony. Tom's mother is lying, and it was Tom who took the book.

The testimony having been made, spurious as it is, the fact that it is unknown to the library detective is of no consequence to his knowledge. Its existence secures defeat. The Collective criticism condition captures this intuition by building the record of challenges addressed into the object of knowledge. Until the library detective is accorded an oportunity to defend his charge against Tom's mother's rebuttal, his inquiry is incomplete, and knowledge eludes.

Similar remarks can be made on behalf of the knowledge of non-social animals. The less developed the inquisitiveness of one's community is, the less refined one's knowledge will be. But it will be markedly easier to obtain and hold on to. Membership in an actively inquiring community is helps one to discover more than they could on their own, but it also makes it more difficult to obtain knowledge of the investigated issue.

### Knowing the truth

Everything known is true, but the inquiry-first account posits complex objects that are not identical to truths. Fortunately, the factivity of knowledge is secured by any object that <em>entails</em> truth, and proper inquiry does. It contains a possibility space that represents the possibilities uneliminated in the course of inquiry. This is a truth apt element and the source of the factivity of knowledge.

Unfortunately, proper inquiry secures truth only <em>in the long run</em>. Inquiry is an extended process, and at intermediate stages of completion, the possibility space may not determine only true propositions. But intermediate-stage inquiry still produces truth, in context.

Inquiry is an iterative process, in which the process is successively reapplied to the output, potentially infinitely. Knowledge ascriptions are simply a report of the process at the stage we choose to cut in at.[^refinement]

## The value of knowledge

One way of understanding the Meno Problem is as presenting the challenge of explaining what makes the state of knowledge more valuable thatn the corresponding state of mere true belief. On this characterization, the presupposition is that there is an intrinsic value-relevant difference between knowledge and mere-true-belief. It is this presupposition that drives questions of the adequacy of reliabilist accounts of justification. For it is presumed that, intrinsically, the outputs of a reliable process are no different from those of an unreliable one. They are both just beliefs. 

There is no shortage of responses to the Meno Problem. Some have tried to take the issue head on by suggesting that the state of knowledge is different from mere-true-belief, perhaps in terms of their modal profiles, and that this difference grounds the value difference in an intrinsic feature of knowledge.

Others have denied the presupposition, suggesting that value need not attach to intrinsic properties of states. For instance, it is natural to maintain that knowledge is not a mere product, but a product *of this reliable belief forming process*. This approach is similar to that advocated by those who take personal identity to determined by mental states arising *from this brain*, or those who take just distributive policies to be those that follow from principles settled upon *by the participants in the original position*. On this view, knowledge is operationally defined. It's value is grounded in its formation history, but this is not an independent feature, for knowledge is a state conjoined with a causal history.

+ The problem is that *possessing* knowledge is what is thought to be of value, but possessing a reliably formed true belief does one nothing that is not provided by possession of any old true belief.

### Swamped by truth

Linda Zagzebski's characterization of what she calls *the value problem* is that all definitions of knowledge that take it to be a value conferring property conjoined to a state of true belief will end up having the value of the conjoined property swamped by the value provided merely by the truth of the belief.

This is especially acute for what Zagzebski calls *machine-product* accounts of knowledge, on which knowledge is taken to be a state that is the output of some state generating process.

But the externalist element of these accounts is not the source of the worry, because internalist accounts that interpret the difference between justified and merely true belief in terms of *truth-conduciveness* also submit to the value problem. Once truth is achieved, truth-conduciveness provides nothing extra. Zagzebski directly addresses Lawrence Bonjour's approach to justification, but the challenge would seemingly apply also to modal accounts such as Williamson's *safety* account. If my belief is true in this world, I get little more out of it also being true in nearby worlds.

The moral Zagzebski takes from the value problem is that we must dismiss the machine-product view of knowledge and accept knowledge as a property of temporally extended agents.

### Justifying processes

But the problem isn't with the machine-product model itself. The problem has to do with the nature of the product. We can imbue the product with the credit deserving feature --  the *account* of the state's genesis. The problem is not the product, but that the process is seen as external to the product. But the insight of dynamic semantics is that these need not be independent. The product encodes the process.

Of course, there is still an issue with the unity of knowledge. Why don't we still have a swamping issue, just now with one part of knowledge swamping the value provided by another part? The answer has to do with the idea of truth-conduciveness as value adding. We have an operational account of knowledge; we also understand truth operationally.

Conduciveness is not a modal property. It is dynamic. Take Meno's first take reposne to Socrates: "The man who has knowledge will get there every time, whereas the man with true opinion will get there only sometimes." I think this is the most natural characterization of the value of knowledge, and it is also the correct one. This is because knowledge isn't valuable as a destination; it is valuable as a means to a destination.

A holistic, dynamic state encodes the process of inquiry, and this is knowledge. The individual beliefs abstracted from the state are known, but they are not the knowledge in so far as knowledge is value additive.

In the belief update literature, knowledge is understood as the fixation of belief. It is the set of worlds to which one does not consider alternatives. This perspective is unlikely to capture the colloquial English use of the word "knowledge", for knowledge of this sort is not factive. But of additional concern for this account is the ability to set off a concept distinct from belief. 

Knowledge is belief with an account.

Zagzebski suggests that the problem is that the value adding function is also the function that produces the belief. But if its value comes from its proficiency at producing true beliefs, then it's value is also swamped by the truth of its product.

We can then (i) deny the machine-product model, (ii) devise another value for the production mechanism that is independent of the intrinsic properties of the end product, or (iii) expand the product to include parts that are both independently valuable and dependent upon the production means.

Ways Zagzebski explains the problem:
  
+ The external nature of the value adding property (unity)

## Contextualism and relativism

If Brisco and Green both believe that they've got the culprit, then they will act in similar ways. They'll look to elicit a confession, offer up bargains, or threaten physical violence. But if Brisco's suspect is in confession room A while Green's is in B, then their actions will have quite different import.[^brisco] In one sense, Brisco and Green believe the same thing, but in another sense, they believe differently.

The fact that sameness of belief is two-sided in this way is brought out in the differences between a relativist and a contextualist approach to attitude ascriptions such as *Brisco believes that the culprit acted alone*. Relativists take belief to be a relation to a property -- one that a person stands in when she self-ascribes that property.[^centeredworlds] The agreement between Brisco and Green then comes from their both self-ascribing the property of *currently interrogating the culprit*. Their disagreement comes from the fact that Brisco self-ascribes the property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room A* and Green self-ascribes the property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room B*. Since individual people don't co-locate, they can't both possess their respective properties in actuality.

The contextualist views the situation differently. Belief, for the contextualist, is a relation between an individual and a proposition. But context infects the relation as well, and the relations one bears to a proposition need not be stable across changes in context.[^contextualistflavor] So, Brisco and Green definitely disagree.  Hold the context fixed, and Brisco stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room A*, while Green stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room B*. Since individual people don't co-locate, they cannot both, in actuality, believe true things. But, it may yet *appear* that they agree. After all, both Brisco and Green would honestly tell the Liutenant "I'm subjecting the culprit to interrogation." But the contextualist denies that honest reporting tells the whole story. Our words are sensitive to context in a way that our beliefs are not. Their espousal of the same belief is merely superficial.

### Disagreement as lingusitic data

Disagreement has been a bit of a star figure in recent debates in the philosophy of language. Primarily, it has been used as a tool for assessing the adequacy of different proposals for the semantic contribution of certain expressions. The contestants in battle disagreement are *absolutism*, *contextualism*, and *relativism*, and the standard scorecard has absolutism and relativism coming out on top in virtue of their ability to secure constant content across uses of the expression. Genuine disagreement does seem to require something toward which utterances can entail incompatible commitments, but semantic content is not the only contribution an utterance makes to discourse. Contextualism can appeal other elements of utterances, which may both remain constant and serve as the seat of disagreement.

### Commitment and contribution

Plunkett and Sundell

The difference between contextualism and relativism is generally couched in terms of content, but content is not the only semantically relevant element of linguistic utterances. Also associated with what we say is a context change potential. A different way of representing the difference between contextualism and relativism is not in terms of what they mean but what they do.

### The nature of relativism

John MacFarlane characterizes as relativistic any semantic theory that makes essential reference to the context of the <em>assessor</em> of an utterance. And much of the contextualism/relativism debate has centered on who's context matters. But Peter Lasersohn provided an interestingly different take on relativism. His support of relativism was not so much that certain expressions demand that the assessor's context be included but that whose context is important to evaluation is not <em>determined</em> at the point of utterance.

### Joint inquiry and relativism

Joint inquiry, modeled by sandbox-level investigation, suggests exactly this. An individuals utterance is incomplete in an important way, and it calls for completion from one's interlocutors. Thus, evaluation is delayed until the inquiry progresses.  Knowledge, it turns out, is relative; just not in the way we first suspected.

[^2]: Not true. We can make sense of one state strictly containing another.

[^brisco]: In one sense, Brisco and Green disagree in their beliefs. Brisco thinks it was the guy in room A that did it, while Green thinks it was the one in room B. They both think that the person who did it acted alone. In another sense, they agree in what they believe.  Belief is functionally tied to action, and Brisco and Green are acting in very similar ways. While Brisco is putting the screws to the guy in room A, Green has got the guy in room B under a hot lamp. They both have drafted warrant requests, and have finger prints running through the database checker.

[^centeredworlds]: Perhaps not all relativists would be happy with this characterization, taking belief to be a three-place relation among a subject, proposition, and a perspective. But a perspectival proposition is itself a relation; curry that relation and you're left with a property.

[^contextualistflavor]: There are different flavors of contextualism (Stanley, DeRose, Glanzberg, etc) and the differences might make a difference for certain applications. But I'm happy to treat the version in the text as representative in regard to the issue of disagreement.

[^ConversationalForce]: The notion in the text of *contribution type* is related to Paul Portner's *conversational force*, which he sees of as a notion, distinct from illocutionary force, that has implications for aspects of the grammatical system relating to syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

[^supposition]: They are also similar to suppositions in that they seem to be less than fully committal on the part of the speaker. Assertion is generally associated with a commitment that it generates for the speaker.  This commitment involves some evidential relation between the asserter and the information conveyed, though it is controversial just what relation it is. But whatever the relation amounts to, it seems clear that we sometimes offer contributions to discourse that go beyond the evidence we have available. And we do this not just as a means of flouting the rules of discourse, but frequently in order to respect the project of the communicative exchange.

[^connection]: {% include ref.html id="schaffer2005" o="n" %} also explores the nature of knowledge in terms of its connection to inquiry, though the picture of inquiry that he works with differs from the one I will develop here.

[^command]: Sometimes added to this list of contribution types is the *command*, which proposes a non-linguistic demand upon a participant in the inquiry. The appropriate response to such a contribution is to make the world such that the demand is met (or to reject the demand itself).

[^mood]: Each of these contribution types has an associated linguistic mood. Inquiry is a structured process, in which it is important not only what information is available but also how it is to be put to use in reaching the goal. As an implementation of inquiry, linguistic discourse has conventional means of representing how the information is being put to use by a contribution. But the scope of contribution types is not limited by the set of conventional moods. Nor do I think the concept of *linguistic mood* cuts along the same joints as that of *contribution type*. What is important for a contribution type is that there is a recognizably unique way in which information is put to use to further the goals of the inquiry.

[^pedigree]: Levi holds a conservatist view of knowledge in which knowledge is not a matter of *pedigree* (the origins or first principles of its genesis), it is a matter of improvement. Agents needn't be able to justify the composition of their information state as it is; they need only provide justification for the changes they make to it.  Thus, justification comes into play only in comparison of information states; a change from one state to another is justified in so far as the latter state is in some way better than the former. Justifiedness is not a property of information states themselves.

[^whyrevise]: On the picture of inquiry developed by Levi, inquiry both begins and ends in knowledge. As such, each state is as valuable as any other, and there is no inherent impetus to revise one's state. That's true so long as one avoids falling into the trivial state, in which deductive closure forces an expansion of the information state to properly include &#x1d50f;, a state referred to as *epistemic hell*. As long as one avoids epistemic hell, the specification of states of information plus a revision operator tells us nothing about when one ought to revise.
