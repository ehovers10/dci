abstract: 
  It is commonly held that knowledge is the end of inquiry, but if we take this connection seriously, there are significant implications for our understanding of the nature of knowledge. I propose to take at face value the idea that knowledge is whatever we get as output in the process of inquiry. Delving into the nature of inquiry reveals that it is a <em>collaborative</em> endeavor, and so, then is knowledge. This idea has important consequences for explaining the distinctive value of knowledge over true belief and for the contextualism/relativism debate in epistemology.

## Knowledge as the end of inquiry

Inquiry is, according to Robert Stalnaker {% include ref.html id="stalnaker1987" o="" e="," %} "the enterprise of forming, testing, and revising beliefs". This is a goal-directed enterprise. Both the impetus for engaging in inquiry and the procedure of doing so are understood in terms of their contribution to the achievement of some end. 

It is tempting to maintain that the {% include concept.html word='end of inquiry' %} is truth. While possession of the truth may be what the inquirer is after, she wishes to possess it in such a way that she both *recognizes* and *accepts* it as the truth. The goal of engaging in inquiry is to achieve a specific *cognitive* state with true propositions as its content.

In contrast, C.S. Peirce and others following in his wake {% include ref.html id="levi1980" o="n" e="," %} have suggested that truth is too lofty a goal, that the most we can genuinely hope for at the end of inquiry is the *settlement of opinion*, for:
  
> "it is clear that nothing out of the sphere of our knowlege can be our object, for nothing which does not affect the mind can be the motive for mental effort. The most that can be maintained is, that we seek for a belief that we shall *think* to be true. But we think each one of our beliefs to be true, and indeed, it is mere tautology to say so." {% include ref.html id="peirce1877" o="n" e="" p="11" %}
    
In response, we could take the pragmatist bait and insist that truth is the end of inquiry simply because whatever is output from the process of inquiry *just is* truth. But we needn't take this line. We can cleave to a correspondence account of truth while maintaining that the final aim of inquiry involves {% include concept.html word='wide content' %} by delimiting a natural, restricted category of *proper* inquiry that can be reliably expected to produce true propositions. 

Proper inquiry is a rule governed process. Rule-following has the practical advantage of improving the reliability of the inquiry, but this is merely the icing. The principal connection to rule following is a conceptual one. The cognitive state that the inquirer seeks is a *praiseworthy* one, and one does not garner praise simply by stumbling onto true propositions. Undertaking the process of inquiry is important to earning the accolades that come with possessing the truth. 

The end of inquiry, then, is a (i) praseworthy, (ii) cognitive state with (iii) true propositions as its content. In other words, proper inquiry is a process that reliably produces justified, true belief. Modulo Gettier-type complications, the end of inquiry is *knowledge*.

The *knowledge rule of assertion* is the proposal that it is a constitutive norm of assertion that one only assert what one knows. Jonathan Schaffer {% include ref.html id="schaffer2008" o="" %} asks what comes of knowledge when we take the knowledge rule of assertion seriously. His answer is that, since assertion is best seen as taking place within a discourse context structured by the question under discussion {% include ref.html id="roberts1996" o="n" e="," %} and the *QUD* is best represented by the set of its alternative answers {% include ref.html id="groenendijk1984" o="n" e="," %} knowledge is similarly relativized to a set of alternatives to the proposition known. And this makes knowledge look a lot like Schaffer's contrastivist proposal would have it.

This proposal to limn the structure of knowledge by investigating the structure of assertion is motivated by the suggested connection between knowledge and assertion. As Timothy Williamson puts the idea, "it is pointless to ask why the knowledge rule is the rule of assertion. It could not have been otherwise" {% include ref.html id="williamson2000" o="" p="267" e="." %} Knowledge is strongly modally tied to assertion, and modal connections generally bring structural similarity in their wake. Of course, structural similarity is a symmetric relation, and it is feasible to adjust our conception of the structure of assertion to match a particular account of knowledge. But with a well developed theory of assertion in the offing, it is reasonable to let it inform our conception of knowledge.

Similarly, knowledge and inquiry are not a merely incidentally connected. Inquiry is designed with a specific eye toward producing knowledge. Even stronger, it is natural to *define* inquiry operationally as any process whose output is, *ceteris paribus*, knowledge. Properly conducted inquiry results in knowledge properly conceived. If we take this idea seriously, then the structure of knowledge ought to mirror the structure of the outputs of inquiry.[^connection]

Of course, structural similarlity is a symmetric relation; if we had a solid understanding of the nature of knowledge, we could use the *end of* connection to extend our understanding to encompass inquiry as well. But opinion on the nature of knowledge is not nearly settled. I propose to take at face value the idea that the outputs of the process of inquiry are knowledge and, thereby, to provide insight into the structure of the knowledge relation.

Inquiry, as we'll see ([Sect. 2](#the-nature-of-inquiry)), has a structure that evokes its deeply collaborative nature. By way of the *end of* connection, we have reason to represent the knowledge relation as similarly collaborative. In one sense, this idea is quite radical, in that it seems to eliminate the potential for solipsitic knowledge, and that it complicates the relationship between facts and the things that are known. But we can perhaps buff a few of the burrs off this conceptual edge ([Sect. 3](#knowledge-and-knowing)), and the proposal garners support from the puzzles it can help to solve. 

Possessing knowledge is uncontroversially more valuable than possessing merely true belief, but the basis of this judgement is more elusive. The inquiry-first account of knowledge offers a solution to the value of knowledge question ([Sect 4](#the-value-of-knowledge)). 

Intuitions about whether two discourse participants disagree with eachother have been brought forward as evidence for particular semantic theories, but the value of this evidence remains under-developed. The inquiry-first account of knowledge provides a grounding for linguistic intuitions about disagreement and speaks in favor of *relativism* as the semantic theory that best captures those intuitions ([Sect. 5](#contextualism-and-relativism)).

## The nature of inquiry

Peirce conceived of inquiry as divided into three stages: deduction, induction, and abduction. His classification was based on what he took to be the distinctive role, or *mode of reasoning*, that each  plays in the process of increasing scientific knowledge. Our investigation of the nature of inquiry takes us through each of these phases, emphasizing how the function of each phase is represented in the basic structure of proper inquiry. Our characterization of each phase will differ from Peirce's conception, instilling insights from a variety of perspectives on the process of inquiry.

### Deduction

Let us start with epistemic logic, which explicitly embraces the connection between knowledge and inquiry. From the standpoint of epistemic logic, inquiry both begins and ends in knowledge. To engage in the process of inquiry is to perform an operation on an information state, *K*, representing an agent's state of knowledge at a time. Information states can be represented syntactically as a deductively closed set of interpreted sentences of some language, **L**. We can equivalently represent them semantically by assuming a domain, **W**, of points, each of which represents a maximal, consistent set of sentences of **L**. We then render each *K* as an equivalence class of such points relative to the agent's knowledge. In this way, an agent's information state at a time is a set of possible worlds amongst which their knowledge does not decide, and individual sentences carry propositional content, which is itself the maximal set of possible worlds that make the sentence true.

Isaac Levi {% include ref.html id="levi1980" o="" e="" %} advocates an account of knowledge based on the epistemic logic account of the nature of inquiry. According to Levi, "from X's point of view at *t*, there is no difference between what he fully believes at *t* and what he knows at *t*" {% include ref.html id="levi1980" o="" p="28" e="." %} This view excises truth as a component of knowledge for the same reasons that Peirce expounded above; information states are fully internal objects, insensitive to whether they link to the external world. Justification is similarly eliminated on the basis that information states are the inputs to inquiry and such states do not carry their historical provenance with them.

Levi's is a *conservatist* view. Justification is not a matter of *pedigree* (the origins or first principles of an information state's genesis), it is a matter of *improvement*. Agents needn't be able to justify the composition of their information state, only the changes they make to it. Thus, justification comes into play only in comparison of information states; a transition from one state to another, a *revision*, is justified in so far as the latter state is in some way better than the former. That is, there are norms for the *process* of proper inquiry. For Levi, the criterion for appropriate revision is care taken against importing error into one's belief corpus {% include ref.html id="levi1980" o="" p="71" e="." %}

Given the structure of information states as Levi understands them, all revisions are represented by set theoretic operations, principally set intersection and union. From the semantic perspective, intersection of an information state with the propositional content of a sentence represents an *expansion* of one's knowledge; acquiring information involves eliminating worlds from one's consideration as genuine possibilities. Set union represents *contraction*; withdrawing belief and thereby becoming uncertain about some proposition involves adding worlds to one's set of considered possibilities. According to Levi, and what has become known as the *Levi Identity*, all revisions are reducible to some combination of *expansion* and *contraction*.

{% include ex.html type="def" term="Levi Identity" sent="Example" sub="Sub-example" defn="Conceived semantically, all rational information state revision is reducible to some combination of set intersection and union among information states and propositions." %}

The problem of justification is thus reduced to the problem of specifying properties of expansion and contraction operators such that all warranted changes in belief are subsumed under their operation. This captures the deductive phase of inquiry. Given as input a proposition with which an information state is to be revised, there is a set of rules specifying exactly how the revision ramifies through the information state.

### Abduction

On Levi's conception of information states, each state is as valuable as any other, and there is no inherent impetus to revise out of a state one finds onesself in. That's true so long as one avoids falling into the trivial state, in which deductive closure forces an expansion of the information state to include **W**, a state referred to as *epistemic hell*. As long as one avoids epistemic hell, the specification of inquiry in terms of a revision operator defined over information states tells us nothing about when one ought to revise.

If one never revises, one never risks importing error. Levi's rational inquirer can be content to maintain a static belief state, for he knows the only potential criticism comes when he decides to revise. Of course, revision may be forced upon him by quotidian interaction with the world. One's belief state is constantly updated involuntarily by way of one's perceptual input. These updates require maintenance using the same principles of revision. But there is no mechanism, in Levi's system, for initiating inquiry. In the epistemic logic framework, the presentation of a proposition as input to the revision of an information state is an non-rational process.

Peirce recognized that no human agent will be content to stand pat with their knowledge. "The iritation of doubt causes a struggle to attain a state of belief," and this iritation is "the only immediate motive for the struggle to attain belief" {% include ref.html id="peirce1877" o="" p="10" e="." %} While such iritation is a natural state for human inquirers, our current framework has no means of accounting for the conditions under which a rational agent chooses to scratch. 

William James {% include ref.html id="james1896" o="" %} carried this idea further, drawing a distinction between two independent and sometimes conflicting goals for those engaged in the pursuit of knowledge. One is, as Levi suggests, to avoid believing falsehoods, but another, equally important one, is to acquire true beliefs.  A clever agent could meet the goal of avoiding falsehoods by simply believing nothing at all, but they would thereby forfeit the virtue of believing truths. One could, alternatively, meet the goal of believing truths simply by believing everything, but doing so sacrifices entirely achieving the second goal. As James saw it, a strategy of inquiry that floats between these extremes is the path we ought to search for. This suggests that the need for revision is not merely an incidental consequence of our inquisitive minds. It is, instead, an ocassional mandate of proper inquiry that the agent *strive* to believe truths, even if doing so risks importing error.

James famously argued that if one's belief choice is *live*, *momentous*, and *forced*, then the will to believe rationally outstrips the fear of being wrong. But as a set of necessary requirements, this restricts speculative endeavors too much. Inquiry need not be momentous or forced for jumping to a conclusion to be epistemically fruitful. Mere time-sensitivity may be enough. Inquiry is a process that is undertaken by fallible individuals in real time. Such agents have limited access to information and limited resources to dedicate to the process of inquiry. Frequently, action is required before certainty can be obtained. And on many quotidian decision points, the risk of being incorrect is fairly low. It is *because* not every inquiry is momentous that striving for truth (and risking falsehood) is sometimes to be prefered. Let us call this extended conception of the rational development of inquiry the *Jamesian amendment*.

{% include ex.html type="def" term="Jamesian amendment" sent="Example" sub="Sub-example" defn="Rational information state revision is governed by two goals: avoiding error and acquiring truth." %}

The Jamesian amendment makes inquiry an optimization task between taking on too many falsehoods and leaving out too many truths. To accommodate this idea, we need to expand our structural representation of inquiry. The information state model from epistemic logic can account for the error-avoidance goal. But we need a way of representing two elements entailed by the goal of acquiring truth. The first is the *impetus to revise* -- information state structure that captures an inquirer's motivation to strive for knowledge. The second is the *will to believe* -- an account of acceptance of a belief in the absence of certainty in its truth, and an explanation of how this maneuver can be rationally viable.

#### Impetus to revise

To have a call for revision of one's information state is to recognize an inadequacy therein. Inadequacies can be of the sort in which an agent *knows too much*, in the sense that their information state is contradictory and thereby contains too much information.[^knowtoomuch] The means of rectifying this sort of inadequacy is accommodated on the Levi model, in the form of conditions on contraction. While all information states are, for Levi, equal in terms of adequacy, we can set the trivial state aside as the one state that always demands revision, and in particular, revision by contraction out of epistemic hell. 

Inadequacies can also arise when one acknowledges that they *know too little*, in the sense that there is an issue that is not settled by their state of information. This sort of inadequacy is not to be accommodated in Levi's model. As defined so far, information states are nothing more than their members, and each state (potentially) contains infinitely many points. Aside from the situation in which one state strictly contains another, there is no way of saying that one state is more informative than another.[^contain]

Recognition of information state incompleteness is a principal impetus to revise. For a state to represent itself as containing unsettled issues, we need to add structure to the information state. To have an unsettled issue is to have a non-uniformity across the information state with respect to a particular subject matter; certain points represent one resolution of the subject matter, other points a different resolution. Recognition of a non-uniform pattern holding across an information state can be modeled formally by means of a relation *R* defined over the membership of the information state, such that for any two elements of the state, *x* and *y*, *R(x,y)* just in case *x* and *y* agree on the subject matter of *R*. The effect is a partitioning of the information state into equivalence classes with respect to the issue that the agent's information state is unable to settle. The result is an information state that calls for revision, in particular, expansion by elimination of complete cells in the partition.

#### Will to believe

As it currently stands, our model of inquiry allows for propositions to be incorporated into information states in two ways. They can be consequences of evidence the agent acquires through their observational faculties, or they can be entailed by other propositions that are themselves consequences of such evidence. It follows from the Jamesian amendment that a rational inquirer may, at times, be warranted in taking on belief that is not conclusively established by either of these means. But we could easily incorporate this mandate, without modifying the structure of inquiry at all, by loosening the requirement for when a proposition counts as a consequence of an agent's evidence. The most natural constraint involves restricting our evidence to direct observation, but there is nothing in principle from incorporating propositions that merely have the *balance of reasons* tilted in their favor.

The problem with this proposal is the threat it poses to the first epistemic goal of error-avoidance. Once a belief is incorporated into an information state, it can be difficult to excise. And as more beliefs become incorporated, tracing the countours of their relative entrenchment becomes exceedingly tedious. It is granted that the will to believe carries a risk of being wrong. Information states must be insured against this risk, and simply reducing entry requirements for membership in the information state does not provide any assurance.

Additionally, we can here grant Levi's point that there does seem to be a difference between the two cognitive goals. It isn't a difference in significance to the inquiry, but it does provide us with reason to represent differently the incorporation of propositions stemming from the two goals.

James' characterization of the motivation for the will to believe emphasizes that it is the *choice* that is genuine and calls for resolution. The essence of the genuine choice is that no particular resolution of the uncertainty demands selection, but still a selection must be made. We can capture this feature of proposition integration via the will to believe by focusing on the selected proposition's position within the partition we introduced to capture the impetus to revise. The will to believe is nothing more than selecting a prefered resolution of a recognized incompleteness in one's information state. Formally, this amendment requires only that the relation *R* that represents the partition impose an *order* on the members of the state. The result is an information state that both calls for revision and selects a preferred means of doing so. And it does so while insulating the information state from the risk the revision carries.

This extension of inquiry based on the Jamesian amendment is intended to capture the abductive phase of inquiry. The two parts of the extension happen to map onto a commonly cited distinction within the abductive phase {% include ref.html id="campos2011,shanahan1986" o="n" e="." %} *Creative abduction* is associated with the scientific context of discovery. It is involved when an inquirer recognizes a scientifically fruitful question and develops a set of hypotheses that serve as potential answers to that question. Incompleteness, modeled as a partition on an information state, represents the output of creative abduction. The extension does not provide us, specifically, with an account of the conditions under which an agent comes to represent its own incompleteness. And this is all to the good, for creative abduction is notoriously unamenable to logical characterization. We don't have, nor do we want, a topic-neutral story of revision into incompleteness. But the extension does provide a uniform representation of what a state that *calls for* revision looks like.

The second part captures the value of *striving* for truth, which closely resembles the *selective* phase of abduction, in which the scientist chooses from amongst the set of viable hypotheses the one that best answers the question on the basis of a set of criteria that perhaps don't eliminate all other answers completely. This is the mode of reasoning known as *inference to the best explanation*. James' proposal was that, ocassionally, elimination of incompleteness is rationally preferred to remaining ambivalent even at the risk of being wrong. 

Modeling inquiry in this way thus makes it part of the domain of logic to specify the conditions under which this selective abduction is warranted. What makes it the case that it is epistemically appropriate to risk importing error into one's information state? I contend that the rationality of such a maneuver is secured by specific *corrective procedures* embedded in the process of proper inquiry. These procedures are the domain of the inductive phase.

For the deductive phase, the motivation for the structural posit was the error-avoidance goal of proper inquiry. The justification for the specific properties of the revision operator is done piecemeal by way of a demonstration that each rule preserves truth.

But the motivation for the structural posits necessary to capture the abductive phase -- the Jamesian amendment -- changes the game entirely. Demonstration is not the proper method of justification for a solution to an optimization problem. For that, we need two things: (i) a 

### Induction

Induction is normally understood in Peirce's tripartite distinction as an ampliative mode of reasoning in which an inference is made about unobserved items on the basis of observed ones. It is the reasoning involved when one generalizes from facts about a sample to facts about the entire population, whatever that may be. But in another guise, inductive reasoning is the process involved in the scientific testing phase, whereby hypotheses are subjected to empirical investigation, and data is accumulated for the purposes of evaluating the relative success of the various hypotheses. For Humean reasons, it is unclear that the two characterizations can be united under a single formalization of reasoning.

I want to explore the function of induction under its scientific testing guise. Of particular interest is how we can incorporate the virtue of testing as a corrective procedure for the flights of fancy introduced in the abductive phase.

As mentioned above, rational inquirers with finite cognitive capacities have an incentive to form beliefs in the absence of certainty. A preference for belief in the face of uncertainty is further supported by the fact that inquiries are packaged with corrective feedback mechanisms. An important such mechanism is the build-and-test update procedure that inquiry exhibits. Inquiries are cummulatively built in a step by step process. A contribution to the inquiry adds a proposal to the mutual inquiry workspace, making it available to be played around with by subsequent contributions to the inquiry before being ultimately accepted or rejected. 

The Levi model sees the process of inquiry as a binary relation between states of information. We can import information about the genesis of a sentence during the revision phase, and use this to determine whether a sentence deserves entry or retention in our information state. But once the revision takes place, all that information is lost. All sentences in an information state have the same infallible status. It is as if the information state was formed from whole cloth.

But once we open the door to incorporating the goal of truth acquisition into our representation of inquiry, we see inquiry as a *dilated process*. Inter-revision states are not complete states of knowledge. Instead, they are way stations on the road to knowledge. Viewing inquiry as a dilated process provides us with additional properties by which to evaluate the quality of inquiries. Proper inquiry, as a dilated process, involves *coherence* among its contributions. Part of that coherence is that contributions to the inquiry respond appropriately to prior contributions, where appropriateness is judged in terms of the contribution's capacity for bringing us to the end of inquiry.

#### Coherence

#### Collaboration

Testing as a corrective procedure is something that a solitary inquirer can take on themselves. But it's value is most evident in the context of joint inquiry. The primary role of joint inquiry is to expedite what would be an extremely tedious task if attempted alone. Even alone, the task can be sped up via judicious application of speculative intellectual leaps, though the risk involved with doing so cannot be wholly eliminated. The collaborative facet of joint inquiry provides extra motivation for assuming the risk -- the cooperative interlocutor, to the extent she is able, will pull you back from the ledge by voicing her *disagreement*. Disagreement is the tool by which interlocutors can check each other's flights of fancy. It is a tool that rational inquirers both know how to wield and are prepared to let others weild against them.

The success of this procedure depends heavily on a shared understanding of each party's role in the inquiry. An individual can only feel comfortable in proposing a speculative addition to the common ground if they believe that their collaborators will correct their contribution to the best of their ability.  And this requires interlocutors to be more than passive recipients of information.  They must use openings in the conversation to interject disapproval or uncertainty in addition to registering understanding and acceptance of what has been presented.

In proper inquiry, it is not enough that the participants in the inquiry come to accept truths about the world. The process of inquiry, when faithfully undertaken serves to provide its participants with justification for coming to accept the outputs of the process. Having gone through the inquiry is also necessary for the right to believe its outputs. John Stuart Mill's {% include ref.html id="mill1859" o="" %} defense of liberty centrally relies on the corrective value of dispute in proper inquiry. Even in the face of certainty regarding the answer to certain questions, dispute plays an important role in sustaining individual community members' right to believe the accepted truth. 

This makes one's right to believe dependent upon the interlocutors with whom one interacts. Not only are asserters expected to be able to provide reasons for the propositions they propose, hearers are expected to challenge assertions when their content contradicts either their own expectations, or the shared conversational record. 

These commitments of cooperative exchange are realized in certain discourse mechanisms. The hearer has tools at her disposal for challenging assertion.  Primary among these is flat out denial, but often it is not maximally cooperative to flatly deny an assertion for this response has the effect of derailing the progress of the inquiry, and it is too sweeping in its effect.  Utterances involve a great number of parts, any of which may be subject to criticism, but criticizing one part may leave others unscathed.  Thus, hearers also have means for correcting utterances without issuing a blanket denial.

Mill's model of inquiry makes collaboration essential to the process. It is not just that individuals can make use of each other to acquire true beliefs about the world. Earning the right to those beliefs requires individuals to work together, and it foists commitments upon each party: speakers must be ready to defend their claims and hearer's must be prepared to correct claims when they can.

For Mill, it was essential to the justification of beliefs that they withstand continual attack from those who disagree with them. That is, for an individual to justifiably maintain a particular belief, they must be capable of defending that belief against attack from potential, reasonable dissenters. Even stronger, they must actually defend the belief against actual, reasonable dissenters. Marc Moffett {% include ref.html id="moffett2007" o="" %} has suggested that this criterion of individual justified belief is tantamount to what he calls the collective criticism condition, which demands "free and open critical discussion" of beliefs among epistemic peers who hold countervailing beliefs. We thus derive a principle of social epistemics from a principle of individual level justification of belief.

If the process of inquiry is what provides individual level belief justification, then the process of inquiry must make room for the collective criticism condition. It is my contention that natural discourse does just this. Not only are asserters expected to be able to provide reasons for the propositions they propose, hearers are expected to challenge assertions when their content contradicts either their own expectations, or the shared conversational record.

These commitments of cooperative exchange are realized in certain discourse mechanisms. The hearer has certain tools at her disposal for challenging assertion. Primary among these is flat out denial, but often it is not maximally cooperative to flatly deny an assertion for this response has the effect of derailing the progress of the inquiry, and it is too sweeping in its effect. Involve a great number of parts, any of which may be subject to criticism, but criticizing one part may leave others unscathed. Thus, hearers also have means for correcting utterances without issues a blanket denial.

This account of justification is an internalist one. Hearers must be aware of their commitment in securing justification for the speaker, and the speaker must be aware that the hearer is so aware in order to retain genuine warrant for her assertion. (Presumably, this mutual awareness could be iterated indefinitely.) The presence of this mutual awareness of each participant's role in generating justification suggests that not only does the hearer respond to the speaker's proposal, but also that the speaker's proposal will anticipate the hearer's response. Assertions represent, in addition to the content put forward, their anticipation of potential challenges to that content. Call this the corrective potential of an assertion.

The proposal here is that speaker and hearer contributions form a discourse pair, each of which both depends on and puts constraints on the other. A consequence of this model of discourse is that one can get insight into the deep structure of an utterance by looking to the nature of its discourse pair.

A well established application of this idea can be found in the alternative semantics for focus interpretation. It was found that focus placement in responses to questions easily predictable. And the semantic contribution of focus in an utterance matches that of the question to which the utterance is a fellicitous response.

#### Revision history

Dilated inquiry is a collaborative effort, either between different inquirers working together, or a single inquirer working on past progress at a later time. Viable use of the inquiry over the course of time (with different contributors) requires an ability to track the changes the inquiry imposes on the information state.  That is, we need a *revision history*.

Inquiry is not a monotonic process. It moves in starts and spurts. The impetus to revise occassionaly moves the information state into a problematic position, which can only be recognized as needing remedy later on. Remedy requires revision, but there are an infinite number of ways to revise. Directed revision requires a *revision history*.

Knowledge is not, as Levi suggests, merely infallible belief. It requires inter-revision justification. Knowledge requires an account. This too is represented in inquiry (here, I'm flipping the grounding order). Inquiry carries a *revision history*, by way of treating structuring updates as relations-in-intension, instead of directly imposing the structure on the information state.

### Advancing the inquiry

A conjecture is a kind of conversational move. It is defined in terms of the role it plays in advancing the inquiry in which it occurs. While speech acts are finely individuated, there is a small set of {% include concept.html word='contribution' %} types derivable from the goals of inqury.[^ConversationalForce] 

The primary goal of inquiry is to come to know something one did not know at its outset. Thus, an individual can advance us toward that goal by submitting (proposing) information to be taken on as mutually accepted. We call this kind of contribution an {% include concept.html word='assertion.' %}

The end point of an inquiry depends in part on its starting point, which is the *issue* that is to be resolved by the process of inquiry. An individual can submit a new issue to the inquiry to be taken on as providing a new goal for the inquiry.  We call this contribution a {% include concept.html word='question' %}.[^command][^mood]

These commonly cited examples do not provide an exhaustive list of conceptually possible contribution types. I don't intend to provide identity conditions for types of contribution, but the examples do share certain things in common, and their common traits can provide us with criteria for recognizing novel contribution types.

+ Genuine contribution types *operate on* {% include concept.html word='*information*' %} in a distinctive way. Assertions expand the context set, and questions partition it. The currency of inquiry is information, and its value is tied to the ways in which information can be put to use to advance the inquiry toward its goal. 
+ Conversational moves that contribute to inquiry *anticipate an appropriate response*, and *place constraints on the form of the response*. Assertion anticipates either acceptance or rejection of the asserted content, and (modulo repair tactics for failed presuppositions) restricts responses to either acceptance or rejection. Questions anticipate an answer, and restrict responses to those assertions that at least partially resolve the issue raised.[^QACongruence] 
+ Genuine contribution types are performed by way of a *conventionalized linguistic tool*. If a contribution belongs to a specific type, language will have found a way to implement that type. Assertions and questions are stronly tied to linguistic mood, although the connection between these contribution types and mood is a tricky one {% include ref.html id="portner1997,starr2010" o="n" e="." %}

I maintain that conjecture, when paired with a corresponding correction, constitutes a distinct, genuine contribution type. Conjecture is similar to assertion in that it seems to provide a proposal of added information. And similarly to questions, conjectures seem to present an issue that is up for further discussion.[^supposition] But conjectures are distinct from each of these, and call for a unique treatment.  That they earn such status is what I hope to show throughout the course of this project.

## Knowledge and knowing (What do we know?)

Call the result the *inquiry-first* account of knowledge. The object of knowledge is the output of proper inquiry -- a collaborativeely developed structure composed of a possibility space, a set of relations over that space, and a record of the process by which the issue has been resolved. This is a fairly substantial departure from the standard view of knowledge on which it is a relation that holds between an individual and a proposition. But substantial doesn't mean radical, and the proposal is not as divorced from common sense as it may at first seems

### Solitary knowing

If one does not belong to a community of inquirers, then the notion of defending one's contributions makes little practical sense for the solitary inquirer, just as the notion of liberty of opinion has little practical value for the solitary opiner. Still, the hermit, and non-social animals generally, seem capable of possessing knowledge. The *Collective criticism condition* threatens to cut too much. But the inquiry-first account is doubly qualified to account for this knowledge. First, the account requires only that the knower possess the *ability* to defend her beliefs, whether or not they have come under actual threat.[^ability]

Second, the account commits the knower onyl ro defending belief against the *best available* arguments. In the degenerative case, these arguments may not be all that good. A consequence is that knowledge is relative to external factors such as the existence of an engaged community poised to challenge belief. This externalization of the conditions for knowledge is significant, but not unmotivated. Consider the classic cases of external defeaters in the post-Gettier epistemology literature. Gilbert Harman's *library detective* case will do {% include ref.html id="harman1973" o="n" e=":" %}[^goldman]
  
> In front of the library detective, Tom takes a library book from the shelf and hides it in his coat. He then walks out of the library without renting it and brazenly flaunts it outside. The library detective sees all of this and reports it to the police. The library detective is confident that it is Tom who stole the book.
> 
> Later, Tom's mother testifies that Tom has a twin brother who has a naughty streak, and Tom could not have taken the book because he is actually thousands of miles away. The library detective does not hear this testimony. Tom's mother is lying, and it was Tom who took the book.

The testimony having been made, spurious as it is, the fact that it is unknown to the library detective is of no consequence to his knowledge. Its existence secures defeat. The Collective criticism condition captures this intuition by building the record of challenges addressed into the object of knowledge. Until the library detective is accorded an oportunity to defend his charge against Tom's mother's rebuttal, his inquiry is incomplete, and knowledge eludes.

Similar remarks can be made on behalf of the knowledge of non-social animals. The less developed the inquisitiveness of one's community is, the less refined one's knowledge will be. But it will be markedly easier to obtain and hold on to. Membership in an actively inquiring community is helps one to discover more than they could on their own, but it also makes it more difficult to obtain knowledge of the investigated issue.

### Knowing the truth

Everything known is true, but the inquiry-first account posits complex objects that are not identical to truths. Fortunately, the factivity of knowledge is secured by any object that <em>entails</em> truth, and proper inquiry does. It contains a possibility space that represents the possibilities uneliminated in the course of inquiry. This is a truth apt element and the source of the factivity of knowledge.

Unfortunately, proper inquiry secures truth only <em>in the long run</em>. Inquiry is an extended process, and at intermediate stages of completion, the possibility space may not determine only true propositions. But intermediate-stage inquiry still produces truth, in context.

Inquiry is an iterative process, in which the process is successively reapplied to the output, potentially infinitely. Knowledge ascriptions are simply a report of the process at the stage we choose to cut in at.[^refinement]

## The value of knowledge

One way of understanding the Meno Problem is as presenting the challenge of explaining what makes the state of knowledge more valuable thatn the corresponding state of mere true belief. On this characterization, the presupposition is that there is an intrinsic value-relevant difference between knowledge and mere-true-belief. It is this presupposition that drives questions of the adequacy of reliabilist accounts of justification. For it is presumed that, intrinsically, the outputs of a reliable process are no different from those of an unreliable one. They are both just beliefs. 

There is no shortage of responses to the Meno Problem. Some have tried to take the issue head on by suggesting that the state of knowledge is different from mere-true-belief, perhaps in terms of their modal profiles, and that this difference grounds the value difference in an intrinsic feature of knowledge.

Others have denied the presupposition, suggesting that value need not attach to intrinsic properties of states. For instance, it is natural to maintain that knowledge is not a mere product, but a product *of this reliable belief forming process*. This approach is similar to that advocated by those who take personal identity to determined by mental states arising *from this brain*, or those who take just distributive policies to be those that follow from principles settled upon *by the participants in the original position*. On this view, knowledge is operationally defined. It's value is grounded in its formation history, but this is not an independent feature, for knowledge is a state conjoined with a causal history.

+ The problem is that *possessing* knowledge is what is thought to be of value, but possessing a reliably formed true belief does one nothing that is not provided by possession of any old true belief.

### Swamped by truth

Linda Zagzebski's characterization of what she calls *the value problem* is that all definitions of knowledge that take it to be a value conferring property conjoined to a state of true belief will end up having the value of the conjoined property swamped by the value provided merely by the truth of the belief.

This is especially acute for what Zagzebski calls *machine-product* accounts of knowledge, on which knowledge is taken to be a state that is the output of some state generating process.

But the externalist element of these accounts is not the source of the worry, because internalist accounts that interpret the difference between justified and merely true belief in terms of *truth-conduciveness* also submit to the value problem. Once truth is achieved, truth-conduciveness provides nothing extra. Zagzebski directly addresses Lawrence Bonjour's approach to justification, but the challenge would seemingly apply also to modal accounts such as Williamson's *safety* account. If my belief is true in this world, I get little more out of it also being true in nearby worlds.

The moral Zagzebski takes from the value problem is that we must dismiss the machine-product view of knowledge and accept knowledge as a property of temporally extended agents.

### Justifying processes

But the problem isn't with the machine-product model itself. The problem has to do with the nature of the product. We can imbue the product with the credit deserving feature --  the *account* of the state's genesis. The problem is not the product, but that the process is seen as external to the product. But the insight of dynamic semantics is that these need not be independent. The product encodes the process.

Of course, there is still an issue with the unity of knowledge. Why don't we still have a swamping issue, just now with one part of knowledge swamping the value provided by another part? The answer has to do with the idea of truth-conduciveness as value adding. We have an operational account of knowledge; we also understand truth operationally.

Conduciveness is not a modal property. It is dynamic. Take Meno's first take reposne to Socrates: "The man who has knowledge will get there every time, whereas the man with true opinion will get there only sometimes." I think this is the most natural characterization of the value of knowledge, and it is also the correct one. This is because knowledge isn't valuable as a destination; it is valuable as a means to a destination.

A holistic, dynamic state encodes the process of inquiry, and this is knowledge. The individual beliefs abstracted from the state are known, but they are not the knowledge in so far as knowledge is value additive.

In the belief update literature, knowledge is understood as the fixation of belief. It is the set of worlds to which one does not consider alternatives. This perspective is unlikely to capture the colloquial English use of the word "knowledge", for knowledge of this sort is not factive. But of additional concern for this account is the ability to set off a concept distinct from belief. 

Knowledge is belief with an account.

Zagzebski suggests that the problem is that the value adding function is also the function that produces the belief. But if its value comes from its proficiency at producing true beliefs, then it's value is also swamped by the truth of its product.

We can then (i) deny the machine-product model, (ii) devise another value for the production mechanism that is independent of the intrinsic properties of the end product, or (iii) expand the product to include parts that are both independently valuable and dependent upon the production means.

Ways Zagzebski explains the problem:
  
+ The external nature of the value adding property (unity)

## Contextualism and relativism

If Brisco and Green both believe that they've got the culprit, then they will act in similar ways. They'll look to elicit a confession, offer up bargains, or threaten physical violence. But if Brisco's suspect is in confession room A while Green's is in B, then their actions will have quite different import.[^brisco] In one sense, Brisco and Green believe the same thing, but in another sense, they believe differently.

The fact that sameness of belief is two-sided in this way is brought out in the differences between a relativist and a contextualist approach to attitude ascriptions such as *Brisco believes that the culprit acted alone*. Relativists take belief to be a relation to a property -- one that a person stands in when she self-ascribes that property.[^centeredworlds] The agreement between Brisco and Green then comes from their both self-ascribing the property of *currently interrogating the culprit*. Their disagreement comes from the fact that Brisco self-ascribes the property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room A* and Green self-ascribes the property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room B*. Since individual people don't co-locate, they can't both possess their respective properties in actuality.

The contextualist views the situation differently. Belief, for the contextualist, is a relation between an individual and a proposition. But context infects the relation as well, and the relations one bears to a proposition need not be stable across changes in context.[^contextualistflavor] So, Brisco and Green definitely disagree.  Hold the context fixed, and Brisco stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room A*, while Green stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room B*. Since individual people don't co-locate, they cannot both, in actuality, believe true things. But, it may yet *appear* that they agree. After all, both Brisco and Green would honestly tell the Liutenant "I'm subjecting the culprit to interrogation." But the contextualist denies that honest reporting tells the whole story. Our words are sensitive to context in a way that our beliefs are not. Their espousal of the same belief is merely superficial.

### Disagreement as lingusitic data

Disagreement has been a bit of a star figure in recent debates in the philosophy of language. Primarily, it has been used as a tool for assessing the adequacy of different proposals for the semantic contribution of certain expressions. The contestants in battle disagreement are *absolutism*, *contextualism*, and *relativism*, and the standard scorecard has absolutism and relativism coming out on top in virtue of their ability to secure constant content across uses of the expression. Genuine disagreement does seem to require something toward which utterances can entail incompatible commitments, but semantic content is not the only contribution an utterance makes to discourse. Contextualism can appeal other elements of utterances, which may both remain constant and serve as the seat of disagreement.

### Commitment and contribution

Plunkett and Sundell

The difference between contextualism and relativism is generally couched in terms of content, but content is not the only semantically relevant element of linguistic utterances. Also associated with what we say is a context change potential. A different way of representing the difference between contextualism and relativism is not in terms of what they mean but what they do.

### The nature of relativism

John MacFarlane characterizes as relativistic any semantic theory that makes essential reference to the context of the <em>assessor</em> of an utterance. And much of the contextualism/relativism debate has centered on who's context matters. But Peter Lasersohn provided an interestingly different take on relativism. His support of relativism was not so much that certain expressions demand that the assessor's context be included but that whose context is important to evaluation is not <em>determined</em> at the point of utterance.

### Joint inquiry and relativism

Joint inquiry, modeled by sandbox-level investigation, suggests exactly this. An individuals utterance is incomplete in an important way, and it calls for completion from one's interlocutors. Thus, evaluation is delayed until the inquiry progresses.  Knowledge, it turns out, is relative; just not in the way we first suspected.

[^knowtoomuch]: Set aside the sense of *knowing too much* in which an agent has information that it would be in their other interests to remain ignorant of. 

[^inclusion]: This is not completely true; we can make sense of one state strictly containing another.

[^brisco]: In one sense, Brisco and Green disagree in their beliefs. Brisco thinks it was the guy in room A that did it, while Green thinks it was the one in room B. They both think that the person who did it acted alone. In another sense, they agree in what they believe.  Belief is functionally tied to action, and Brisco and Green are acting in very similar ways. While Brisco is putting the screws to the guy in room A, Green has got the guy in room B under a hot lamp. They both have drafted warrant requests, and have finger prints running through the database checker.

[^centeredworlds]: Perhaps not all relativists would be happy with this characterization, taking belief to be a three-place relation among a subject, proposition, and a perspective. But a perspectival proposition is itself a relation; curry that relation and you're left with a property.

[^contextualistflavor]: There are different flavors of contextualism (Stanley, DeRose, Glanzberg, etc) and the differences might make a difference for certain applications. But I'm happy to treat the version in the text as representative in regard to the issue of disagreement.

[^ConversationalForce]: The notion in the text of *contribution type* is related to Paul Portner's *conversational force*, which he sees of as a notion, distinct from illocutionary force, that has implications for aspects of the grammatical system relating to syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

[^QACongruence]: We'll revisit the anticipation and restriction of questions later on when we discuss focus and Q/A Congruence in [Dispute in Discourse](/chapters/dispute-in-discourse.html)

[^supposition]: They are also similar to suppositions in that they seem to be less than fully committal on the part of the speaker. Assertion is generally associated with a commitment that it generates for the speaker.  This commitment involves some evidential relation between the asserter and the information conveyed, though it is controversial just what relation it is. But whatever the relation amounts to, it seems clear that we sometimes offer contributions to discourse that go beyond the evidence we have available. And we do this not just as a means of flouting the rules of discourse, but frequently in order to respect the project of the communicative exchange.

[^connection]: {% include ref.html id="schaffer2005" o="n" %} also explores the nature of knowledge in terms of its connection to inquiry, though the picture of inquiry that he works with differs from the one I will develop here.

[^command]: Sometimes added to this list of contribution types is the *command*, which proposes a non-linguistic demand upon a participant in the inquiry. The appropriate response to such a contribution is to make the world such that the demand is met (or to reject the demand itself).

[^mood]: Each of these contribution types has an associated linguistic mood. Inquiry is a structured process, in which it is important not only what information is available but also how it is to be put to use in reaching the goal. As an implementation of inquiry, linguistic discourse has conventional means of representing how the information is being put to use by a contribution. But the scope of contribution types is not limited by the set of conventional moods. Nor do I think the concept of *linguistic mood* cuts along the same joints as that of *contribution type*. What is important for a contribution type is that there is a recognizably unique way in which information is put to use to further the goals of the inquiry.

[^ability]: Is this true? Haven't I build *actual* collaboration into the framework by way of the sandbox?

[^refinement]: This picture is fitting for our account of refinement to be addressed in the last chapter.

[^multiknowledge]: It is thus a consequence of Levi's approach to inquiry as transition between states of knowledge following the dictates of a revision operator that there can be multiple, incompatible states of knowledge.

[^agm]: The classic treatment of contraction is AGM (Alchourron 1985), and I refer the reader there for details on the relation.

[^contain]: Even in the case of containment, having more information does not necessarily make the state more desirable. The more informative state involves one way of expanding from the less informative one. But independent of knowledge of the *alternative* expansions, there is no saying that such an expansion ought to be carried out.
