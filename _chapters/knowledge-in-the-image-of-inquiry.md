abstract: 
  It is commonly held that knowledge is the end of inquiry, but if we take this connection seriously, there are significant implications for our understanding of the nature of knowledge. I propose to take at face value the idea that knowledge is whatever we get as output in the process of inquiry. Delving into the nature of inquiry reveals that it is a <em>collaborative</em> endeavor, and so, then is knowledge. This idea has important consequences for explaining the distinctive value of knowledge over true belief and for the contextualism/relativism debate in epistemology.

## The end of inquiry

Inquiry is, according to Robert Stalnaker {% include ref.html id="stalnaker1987" o="" e="," %} "the enterprise of forming, testing, and revising beliefs". This is a goal-directed enterprise. Both the impetus for forming, testing, and revising beliefs and the procedure of doing so are understood in terms of their contribution to the achievement of some end. 

It is tempting to maintain that the {% include concept.html word='end of inquiry' %} is truth. While possession of the truth may be what the inquirer is after, she wishes to possess it in such a way that she both *recognizes* and *accepts* it as the truth. The goal of engaging in inquiry is to achieve a *cognitive* state with true propositions as its content.

In contrast, C.S. Peirce and others following in his wake {% include ref.html id="levi1980" o="n" e="," %} have suggested that truth is too lofty a goal; that the most we can genuinely hope for at the end of inquiry is the *settlement of opinion*, for:
  
> "it is clear that nothing out of the sphere of our knowlege can be our object, for nothing which does not affect the mind can be the motive for mental effort. The most that can be maintained is, that we seek for a belief that we shall *think* to be true. But we think each one of our beliefs to be true, and indeed, it is mere tautology to say so." {% include ref.html id="peirce1877" o="n" e="" p="11" %}
    
In response, we could take the pragmatist bait and insist that truth is the end of inquiry simply because whatever is output from the process of inquiry *just is* truth. But we needn't take this line. We can cleave to a correspondence account of truth while maintaining that final aim of inquiry involves {% include concept.html word='wide content' %} by delimiting a natural, restricted category of *proper* inquiry that can be reliably expected to produce true propositions. 

Principally, proper inquiry is a rule governed process. Rule-following has the practical advantage of improving the reliability of the inquiry, but the connection to rule following is a conceptual one. The cognitive state that the inquirer seeks is *praiseworthy*, and one does not garner praise simply by stumbling onto true propositions. Undertaking the process of inquiry is important to earning the accolades that come with possessing the truth. 

The end of inquiry, then is a valuable, cognitive state with true propositions as its content. Specifically, proper inquiry is a process that reliably produces justified, true belief. Modulo Gettier-type complications, the end of inquiry is *knowledge*.

If we had a solid understanding of the nature of knowledge, we could use the *end of* connection to extend our understanding to encompass inquiry as well. But the nature of knowledge is highly contested, and connections go both ways. I propose to investigate the basic structure of proper inquiry by looking to specific historical accounts of its importance, to take at face value the idea that the outputs of the process of inquiry are knowledge, and thereby to provide insight into the structure of the knowledge relation.

The key insight that arises from this investigation into proper inquiry is that it is a deeply collaborative process. By way of the *end of* connection, we have reason to represent the knowledge relation as similarly collaborative. In one sense, this idea is quite radical, in that it seems to eliminate the potential for solipsitic knowledge. But we can perhaps buff a few of the burrs off this conceptual edge, and the proposal garners support from the puzzles it can help to solve.

## The structure of knowledge

The *knowledge rule of assertion* is the proposal that it is a constitutive norm of assertion that one only assert what one knows. Jonathan Schaffer (2008) asks what comes of knowledge when we take the knowledge rule of assertion seriously. His answer is that, since assertion is best seen as taking place within a discourse context structured by the question under discussion (QUD, see Roberts (1996)), and the QUD is best represented by the set of its alternative answers (Groenendijk and Stokhof (1984)), knowledge is similarly relativized to a set of alternatives to the proposition known. And this makes knowledge look a lot like the contrastivist proposal would have it.

Schaffer's proposal to limn the structure of knowledge by investigating the structure of assertion is motivated by the suggested connection between knowledge and assertion. As Timothy Williamson puts the idea, "it is pointless to ask why the knowledge rule is the rule of assertion. It could not have been otherwise" (2000 p. 267). Knowledge is strongly modally tied to assertion, and modal connections generally bring structural similarity in their wake. Of course, structural similarity is a symmetric relation, and it is feasible to adjust our conception of the structure of assertion to match a particular account of knowledge. But with a well developed theory of assertion in the offing, it is reasonable to let it inform our conception of knowledge.

Similarly, knowledge and inquiry not a merely incidentally connected. Inquiry is designed with a specific eye toward producing knowledge. In fact, we can provide an operational definition of inquiry as that (any) process whose output is, *ceteris paribus*, knowledge. Properly conducted inquiry results in knowledge properly conceived. If we take this idea seriously, then the structure of knowledge ought to mirror the structure of the outputs of inquiry, and inquiry, as we've seen from the discussion of discourse dynamics, outputs *information states*, where an information state is an articulated structure involving a context set, a set of relations-in-intension among the elements of the context set, and a domain of discourse referents. 

In addition, if the conjecture/correction process is an essential element of inquiry, then the inputs and outputs operated on over the course of the inquiry are conjectural skeletons whose saturation may develop over the course of the inquiry.

### Inquiry as belief revision

I think that distinctive features that the collaborative account entails for the outputs of inquiry provide valuable insight when transfered over as features of the knowledge relation. Isaac Levi (esp. 1980), too, thinks that we can extract information regarding the nature of knowledge from our representation of the nature of inquiry, but he has a very different view of the nature of inquiry. Levi denies Peirce's characterization of the ultimate end of inquiry as "approaching the true complete story of the world" (Levi 1980, p. 70). His concern is with the idea that ordinary inquiry can be understood in terms of such far-reaching objectives. Instead, he understands the aim of inquiry as *error-avoidance* (p. 71). For Levi, inquiry involves the change of bodies of belief, and the criterion for appropriate such changes is care taken against importing error into one's belief corpus. One need only concern herself with this immediate change.

Though his characterization of the aim of inquiry is different, the end result is the same. Assuming that proper inquiry doesn't result in the expansion of one's belief corpus with merely incidentally error free information, the end of inquiry is knowledge.

But Levi does not think that this requires us to represent belief bodies (my *information states*) with an articulated structure. Instead, he takes the standard approach of epistemic logic in which an information state (&#x1d472;) is represented by a deductively closed set (&#x1d43e;) of interpreted sentences of some language (&#x1d50f;). This is the syntactic standpoint on information states. We can equivalently represent them semantically by assuming a domain of points representing maximal, consistent sets of sentences of &#x1d50f;, and treating each &#x1d43e; as an equivalence class of such points relative to the agent's beliefs. In this way, an agent's information state is their "standard for serious possibility" (Levi 1980, p. 8), represented as a set of possible worlds amongst which their knowledge does not decide.

Levi holds a conservatist view of knowledge in which knowledge is not a matter of *pedigree* (the origins or first principles of its genesis), it is a matter of improvement. Agents needn't be able to justify the composition of their information state as it is; they need only provide justification for the changes they make to it.  Thus, justification comes into play only in comparison of information states; a change from one state to another is justified in so far as the latter state is in some way better than the former. Justifiedness is not a property of information states themselves.

Thus, Levi has the commitment of accounting for the difference between changes that *improve* one's information state from those that make it no better. Only the former are motivated, and justification must be provided to demonstrate that a change is in that category. Let's call any change made to an information state a *revision*. Given the structure of information states as Levi understands them, all revisions are represented by set theoretic operations. The two principle such operations are set intersection, which (on the semantic conception) represents an *expansion* of the information state -- acquiring information involves eliminating worlds from one's consideration as a genuine possibility; and set union, which represents *contraction* -- withdrawing belief and thereby becoming uncertain about some proposition involves adding worlds to one's set of considered possibilities. According to Levi, and what has become known as the *Levi Identity*, all revisions are reducible to some combination of *expansion* and *contraction*.

The problem of justification, then, is to specify the properties of the expansion and contraction operators such that all warranted changes in belief are subsumed under their operation. For Levi, knowledge is both the beginning and end of inquiry, and the process of inquiry is transition between such states, characterized by principles of appropriate expansion and contraction.

Expansion is the easier of the two operations to understand. Syntactically, the operation involves adding a sentence to the information state and taking the deductive closure of the result. Semantically, this is just the intersection of the state of information with the state representing the expansion proposition. Given the deductive closure constraint on information states, there is only one viable expansion operation. 

There is more room for nuance in specifying the contraction operation, for there is more than one way to remove information from the information state. The classic treatment of contraction is AGM (Alchourron 1985), and I refer the reader there for details on the relation. The primary takeaway for our purposes is that rationality does not determine a unique operation on one's state of information in response to removing a belief from consideration. For any instance of contraction, there will be potential belief states that are incompatible but between which there is no way of determining the better and the worse. They are all equally well justified, and since they result from the process of proper inquiry, they are equally states of knowledge. 

It is thus a consequence of Levi's approach to inquiry as transition between states of knowledge following the dictates of a revision operator that there can be multiple, incompatible states of knowledge.

### The impetus to revise

On the picture of inquiry developed by Levi, inquiry both begins and ends in knowledge. As such, each state is as valuable as any other, and there is no inherent impetus to revise one's state. That's true so long as one avoids falling into the trivial state, in which deductive closure forces an expansion of the information state to properly include &#x1d50f;, a state referred to as *epistemic hell*. As long as one avoids epistemic hell, the specification of states of information plus a revision operator tells us nothing about when one ought to revise.

This is perhaps fine with Levi, whose stated view of inquiry is as a means to error avoidance. If one never revises, one never risks importing error. And if one must revise, then do so by the precepts of expansion and contraction. 

But this is where Levi parts ways with Peirce. Levi's rational inquirer can be content to maintain a static belief state, for he knows the only potential criticism comes when he decides to revise. Of course, revision may be forced upon him by quotidian interaction with the world. One's belief state is constantly updated involuntarily by way of one's perceptual input. These updates require maintenance using the same principles of revision. But there is no mechanism, in Levi's system, for initiating inquiry. 

Peirce, on the other hand, and William James following him, ackowledge that error avoidance is only one epistemic duty. There is, in addition, a drive to acquire truth, inspired by what Peirce calls "the irritation of doubt" (*The Fixation of Belief*, p. 10). To take this stance is to hold that no information state, aside from those of complete information (and maybe not even those, if we heed Mill's edicts on expressive freedom), is stable; there is always a call for revision.

To accommodate this idea, we need to represent both *information state inadequacy* and the *impetus for revision of inadequate states*. To have a call for revision of one's information state is to recognize an inadequacy therein. 

#### Equilibrium conditions v. goals of inquiry

Levi grants that striving for truth can play a role in inquiry. He suggests that an inquirer *X* 

> "should be concerned not merely to avoid error but to acquire new information. The promise of obtaining new information may sometimes (though not always) compensate *X*, from his initial point of view, for the risk to be incurred" (1980 p.35).

Lip service is certainly being paid to the goal of acquiring truths, but this goal is given second class standing when it comes to the structure of inquiry. Levi draws a distinction between what he calls *equilibrium conditions* on rationality, which represent commitments that an agent acquires as a basis of logic given that they possess a particular belief corpus; and commitments that the individual bears in virtue of her cognitive goals. The commitment to believing *p &amp; q* when you believe *p* and believe *q* qualifies as an equilibrium condition. But the commitment to maintaining a consistent belief corpus does not. Levi sees no reason to deny the inconsistent information state status as a viable state. But he agrees that one would be well advised both to revise away from it when one finds oneself in that state and also to avoid revising into it when one is considering a transition. The difference is that this advice stems from the *goal* of inquiry as avoiding error. The inconsistent state is guaranteed to contain error; in so far as one is motivated by the goal of inquiry, one ought to be motivated to avoid it.

The implication is that while equilibrium conditions receive direct representation in the inquiry structure, by way of the deductive closure constraint on viable information states and the properties of the revision operator, mere cognitive goal-generated constraints do not.

I don't see a non-question begging motivation for this distinction. It is true that equilibrium conditions are directly represented in Levi's characterization of inquiry by way of the rules on the revision operator, whereas commitments generated from an agents cognitive goals are not so represented. But the question of how to represent inquiry is the very topic of investigation, and principles of consistency, for instance, seem antecedently as central to proper inquiry as conjunctive syllogism. 

Perhaps equilibrium conditions are to be understood as invoking isolated adjustments to a portion of an information state, whereas cognitive goal generated commitments are holistic in that they make essential reference to an information state as a whole. Even if this distinction can be upheld, it does not carry the weight needed to exclude cognitive goal commitments from representation in the structure of inqury. Inquiry is a complex and dilated process, and it is intended to be a topic-neutral characterization of knowledge incrementation. As such, there is nothing precluding inquiry from being self-referential. We may even find that that there are gains in efficiency to be had by being able to reference entire information states in the course of inquiry.

Nor is the atomic/holistic distinction adhered to in Levi's explicit position on inquiry. He thinks it is a fault of other discussions of inquiry that they treat revisions as adding or subtracting individual belief from a corpus. Instead, for Levi, revision does not take place by adding or subtracting single sentences from a corpus, it is always a "set of sentences of propositions added to a corpus to make a deductively closed set" (p.27).

Levi worries that the goal of truth acquisition is topic-specific while the goal of error avoidance is universal. Perhaps we could motivate the distinction as one of topic-neutrality. The inquiry structure is meant to have universal application, but if there is no universal way to represent the goal of truth acquisition, then it is not a structural element of inquiry. Levi is right that the particular demands of acquiring truth will depend on the topic of investigation, but so too do the demands of error avoidance. What matters is whether we can introduce structural elements to model the process of truth acquisition, just as the revision operator models the process of error avoidance. If a theoretically virtuous (simple, unifying, productive) model can be provided, there seems to be no principled reason of barring the antecedently motivated goal of truth acquisition from the inquiry representation.

We ought to let the demands of empirical coverage guide our thoeretical posits. I take it that conversation realizes inquiry, and as such analysis of the distribution of expressions in conversation bears on the nature of inquiry. If our best theories of particular lingusitic expressions reference semantic structures that walk and quack like cognitive goal-generated commitments, then inquiry ought to accommodate them. Such expressions are waddling all over the place:
  
+ Modals
+ Evidentials
+ Speach acts
+ Conditionals

### Issues and partitions

Inadequacies can be of the sort in which a state contains too much information; that is, it involves a contradiction.[^1] Revision of this sort of inadequacy is accommodated on the Levi model. While all information states are, for Levi, equal in terms of adequacy, we can set the trivial state aside as the one state that always demands revision, and in particular, revision by contraction out of epistemic hell. 

Inadequacies can also arise when one acknowledges that their information state contains too little information; that is, one becomes aware of an issue that is not settled by their state of information. This sort of inadequacy is not to be accommodated in Levi's model. Primarily, all non-trival information states are equivalently adequate. But additionally, all states of information are is their members, and there is no means of ranking states based on their membership.[^2] Each state contains infinitely many points. Aside from the situation in which one state strictly contains another, there is no way of saying that one state is more informative than another. Even in the case of containment, having more information does not necessarily make the state more desirable. The more informative state involves one way of expanding from the less informative one. But independent of knowledge of the *alternative* expansions, there is no saying that such an expansion ought to be carried out.

For a state to represent itself as containing unsettled issues, we need to add structure to the information state. To have an unsettled issue is to have a non-uniformity across the information state with respect to a particular subject matter; certain points represent one resolution of the subject matter, other points a different resolution. 

## Dilated processes

Levi sees the process of inquiry as a binary relation between states of information. We can import information about the genesis of a sentence during the revision phase, and use this to determine whether a sentence deserves entry or retention in our information state. But once the revision takes place, all that information is lost. All sentences in an information state have the same infallible status. It is as if the information state was formed from whole cloth.

But once we open the door to incorporating the goal of truth acquisition into our representation of inquiry, we see inquiry as a dilated process. Inter-revision states are not complete states of knowledge. Instead, they are way stations on the road to knowledge. States are integrated such that it is possible to reference past states in our revision rules. Since the properties of the revision operator represent the diachronic justification of belief, proper revision in a dilated structure of integrated states requires respecting a *plan of inquiry*.

### Plans in general

{% include_relative sections/sect.html title="plans" %}

### Plans of inquiry

Plans so conceived are obviously valuable to Levi's project of determining the appropriate rules for *the fixation of belief and its undoing*. I suggest that planning is a fully integrated element of inquiry deriving from their dilated nature. As such, our structure of inquiry ought to represent it as implementing a plan. 

Daniel Buring has also invoked plans of inquiry in a slightly different context. He suggests that plans of inquiry are valuable for making sense of the discourse contribution of *contrastive topic*.

#### The problem of contrastive topic

{% include_relative sections/sect.html title="the-problem-of-contrastive-topic" %}

### Grades of self-reference

+ Inquiry is both synchronically and diachronically self-referential.
+ Synchronic self-reference is represented by tests on information states. The state as a whole is checked for some property, rather than directly adjusting its membership
+ Diachronic self-reference involves revision on the basis of phases of the state evolution either prior to or in the future of the state at which the revision is applied.
+ The most common diachronic self-referential mechanism is presupposition. 
+ But conjecture and correction are also diachronicly self-referential mechanisms. Conjecture demands a future (perhaps trivial) revision, and correction references past states in its revision.
+ Assertion and questioning, too, are diachronic, but they are predominantly trivially so, they require only acceptance or rejection.

### Joint inquiry

Dilated inquiry is a collaborative effort, either between different inquirers working together, or a single inquirer working on past progress at a later time. Viable use of the inquiry over the course of time (with different contributors) requires an ability to track the changes the inquiry imposes on the information state.  That is, we need a *revision history*.

Inquiry is not a monotonic process. It moves in starts and spurts. The impetus to revise occassionaly moves the information state into a problematic position, which can only be recognized as needing remedy later on. Remedy requires revision, but there are an infinite number of ways to revise. Directed revision requires a *revision history*.

Knowledge is not, as Levi suggests, merely infallible belief. It requires inter-revision justification. Knowledge requires an account. This too is represented in inquiry (here, I'm flipping the grounding order). Inquiry carries a *revision history*, by way of treating structuring updates as relations-in-intension, instead of directly imposing the structure on the inforamtion state.



[^1]: We set aside the issue in which one *knows too much* in the sense that they have information that it would be in their other interests to remain ignorant of. 
[^2]: Not true. We can make sense of one state strictly containing another.

If knowledge is represented by discourse level information states, and "knows that" expresses the knowledge relation, then "knows that" makes a self-referential contribution to discourse.
