abstract:
  It is commonly held that knowledge is the end of inquiry, but if we take this connection seriously, there are significant implications for our understanding of the nature of knowledge. I propose to take at face value the idea that knowledge is whatever we get as output in the process of inquiry. Delving into the nature of inquiry reveals that it is a <em>collaborative</em> endeavor, and so, then is knowledge. This idea has important consequences for explaining the distinctive value of knowledge over true belief and for the contextualism/relativism debate in epistemology.

## Knowledge as the end of inquiry

Inquiry is a process whereby individuals form, revise, and otherwise manipulate their mental states.[^inquiryStalnaker] This is a goal-directed enterprise; both the impetus for engaging in inquiry and the procedure of doing so are understood in terms of their contribution to the achievement of some end.

It is tempting to maintain that the {% include appendices/word.html word='end of inquiry' %} is truth. While possession of the truth may be what the inquirer is after, she wishes to possess it in such a way that she both *recognizes* and *accepts* it as the truth. The goal of engaging in inquiry is thus to achieve a specific, *cognitive* state with true propositions as its content.

C.S. Peirce and others following in his wake {% include appendices/ref.html id="levi1980" o="n" e="," %} have suggested that so strong a cognitive tie to truth is too lofty a goal. They emphasize that assurance of truth is beyond our ken and that the most we can genuinely hope for at the end of inquiry is the *settlement of opinion*, for:

> "it is clear that nothing out of the sphere of our knowlege can be our object, for nothing which does not affect the mind can be the motive for mental effort. The most that can be maintained is, that we seek for a belief that we shall *think* to be true. But we think each one of our beliefs to be true, and indeed, it is mere tautology to say so." {% include appendices/ref.html id="peirce1877" o="n" e="" p="11" %}

It is possible to take the pragmatist bait and insist that truth is still the end of inquiry by accepting that whatever is output from the process of inquiry *just is* truth. More conservatively, we can cleave to a correspondence account of truth while maintaining that the final aim of inquiry involves {% include appendices/word.html word='wide content' %} by delimiting a natural, restricted category of *proper* inquiry that can be reliably expected to produce true propositions. We then shift our focus to characterizing the nature of *proper inquiry*.

Proper inquiry is a rule governed process. Rule-following has the practical advantage of improving the reliability of the inquiry, but this is merely the icing. The principal connection to rule following is a conceptual one. The cognitive state that the inquirer seeks is a *praiseworthy* one, and one does not garner praise simply by stumbling onto true propositions. Undertaking the process of inquiry is important to earning the accolades that come with possessing the truth.

The end of proper inquiry, then, is a (i) praseworthy, (ii) cognitive state with (iii) true propositions as its content. Only slightly tendentiously, proper inquiry is a process that reliably produces justified, true belief. Modulo Gettier-type complications, the end of proper inquiry is *knowledge*.

The *knowledge rule of assertion* is the proposal that it is a constitutive norm of assertion that one only assert what one knows. Jonathan Schaffer {% include appendices/ref.html id="schaffer2008" o="" %} asks what comes of knowledge when we take the knowledge rule of assertion seriously. His answer is that, since assertion is best seen as taking place within a discourse context structured by the question under discussion {% include appendices/ref.html id="roberts1996" o="n" e="," %} and the *QUD* is best represented by the set of its alternative answers {% include appendices/ref.html id="groenendijk1984" o="n" e="," %} knowledge is similarly relativized to a set of alternatives to the proposition known. And this makes knowledge look a lot like Schaffer's {% include appendices/ref.html id="schaffer2005" o="" %} contrastivist proposal would have it.

This proposal to limn the structure of knowledge by investigating the structure of assertion is motivated by the suggested connection between knowledge and assertion. As Timothy Williamson puts the idea, "it is pointless to ask why the knowledge rule is the rule of assertion. It could not have been otherwise" {% include appendices/ref.html id="williamson2000" o="" p="267" e="." %} Knowledge is strongly modally tied to assertion, and modal connections generally bring structural similarity in their wake. Of course, structural similarity is a symmetric relation, and it is feasible to adjust our conception of the structure of assertion to match a particular account of knowledge. But with a well developed theory of assertion in the offing, it is reasonable to let it inform our conception of knowledge.

Similarly, knowledge and inquiry are not merely incidentally connected. Inquiry is designed with a specific eye toward producing knowledge. Even stronger, it is natural to *define* inquiry operationally as any process whose output is, *ceteris paribus*, knowledge. Properly conducted inquiry results in knowledge properly conceived. If we take this idea seriously, then the structure of knowledge ought to mirror the structure of the outputs of inquiry.[^connection]

*Inquiry* and *knowledge* are both opaque, high level concepts and structural similarlity is a symmetric relation. If we had a solid understanding of the nature of knowledge, we could use the *end of* connection to extend our understanding of inquiry as well. But opinion on the nature of knowledge is not nearly settled. I propose to take at face value the idea that the outputs of the process of inquiry are knowledge and, thereby, to provide insight into the structure of the knowledge relation. Call this the *inquiry-first* conception of knowledge.

Inquiry, as we'll see ([Sect. 2](#the-nature-of-inquiry)), has a structure that evokes its deeply collaborative nature. In light of the proposed connection, we have reason to represent the knowledge relation as similarly collaborative. In one sense, this idea is quite radical, in that it seems to eliminate the potential for solipsitic knowledge, and that it complicates the relationship between facts and the things that are known. But we can perhaps buff a few of the burrs off this conceptual edge ([Sect. 3](#knowledge-and-knowing)), and the proposal garners support from the puzzles it can help to solve.

Possessing knowledge is uncontroversially more valuable than possessing merely true belief, but the basis of this judgement is more elusive. The inquiry-first conception of knowledge offers a solution to the value of knowledge question ([Sect 4](#the-value-of-knowledge)).

Intuitions about whether two discourse participants disagree with eachother have been brought forward as evidence for particular semantic theories, but the value of this evidence remains under-developed. The inquiry-first conception of knowledge provides a grounding for linguistic intuitions about disagreement and speaks in favor of *relativism* as the semantic theory that best captures those intuitions ([Sect. 5](#contextualism-and-relativism)).

## The nature of inquiry

Peirce conceived of inquiry as divided into three stages: deduction, induction, and abduction. His classification was based on what he took to be the distinctive role, or *mode of reasoning*, that each  plays in the process of increasing scientific knowledge. Our investigation of the nature of inquiry takes us through each of these phases, emphasizing how the function of each phase is represented in the basic structure of proper inquiry. Our characterization of each phase will differ from Peirce's conception, instilling insights from a variety of perspectives on the process of inquiry.

### Deduction

Let us start with epistemic logic, which explicitly embraces the connection between knowledge and inquiry. From the standpoint of epistemic logic, inquiry both begins and ends in knowledge. To engage in the process of inquiry is to perform an operation on an information state, *K*, representing an agent's state of knowledge at a time. Information states can be represented syntactically as a deductively closed set of interpreted sentences of some language, **L**. We can equivalently represent them semantically by assuming a domain, **W**, of points, each of which represents a maximal, consistent set of sentences of **L**. We then render each *K* as an equivalence class of such points relative to the agent's knowledge. In this way, an agent's information state at a time is a set of possible worlds amongst which their knowledge does not decide. Individual sentences carry propositional content, which is itself the maximal set of possible worlds that make the sentence true.

Isaac Levi {% include appendices/ref.html id="levi1980" o="" e="" %} advocates an account of knowledge based on the epistemic logic view of inquiry. Levi's proposal is a radical departure from the standard *justified, true, belief* account of knowledge. He suggests that "from X's point of view at *t*, there is no difference between what he fully believes at *t* and what he knows at *t*" {% include appendices/ref.html id="levi1980" o="" p="28" e="." %} This view excises truth as a component of knowledge for the same reasons that Peirce expounded above; information states are fully internal objects, insensitive to whether they link to the outside world. Justification is similarly eliminated on the basis that information states are the inputs to inquiry and such states do not carry their historical provenance with them.

Levi's is a *conservatist* view. Justification is not a matter of *pedigree* (the origins or first principles of an information state's genesis), it is a matter of *improvement*. Agents needn't be able to justify the composition of their information state, only the changes they make to it. Thus, justification comes into play only in comparison of information states; a transition from one state to another, a *revision*, is justified in so far as the latter state is in some way better than the former. That is, there are norms for the *process* of proper inquiry. For Levi, the criterion for appropriate revision is care taken against importing error into one's belief corpus {% include appendices/ref.html id="levi1980" o="" p="71" e="." %}

Given the structure of information states as Levi understands them, all revisions are represented by set theoretic operations, principally set intersection and union. From the semantic perspective, intersection of an information state with the propositional content of a sentence represents an *expansion* of one's knowledge; acquiring information involves eliminating worlds from one's consideration as genuine possibilities. Set union represents *contraction*; withdrawing belief and thereby becoming uncertain about some proposition involves adding worlds to one's set of considered possibilities. According to Levi, and what has become known as the *Levi Identity*, all revisions are reducible to some combination of *expansion* and *contraction*.

<!-- Levi identity -->
{% assign leviidentity = site.data.definitions["levi identity"] %}
{% include examples/def.html type="def" term="Levi Identity" defn=leviidentity %}

The problem of justification is thus reduced to the problem of specifying properties of expansion and contraction operators such that all warranted changes in belief are subsumed under their operation. This captures the deductive phase of inquiry. Given as input a proposition with which an information state is to be revised, there is a set of rules specifying exactly how the revision ramifies through the information state.

### Abduction

On Levi's conception of information states, each state is as valuable as any other, and there is no inherent impetus to revise out of a state one finds onesself in. That's true so long as one avoids falling into the trivial state, in which deductive closure forces an expansion of the information state to include **W**, a state referred to as *epistemic hell*. As long as one avoids epistemic hell, the specification of inquiry in terms of a revision operator defined over information states tells us nothing about when one ought to revise.

If one never revises, one never risks importing error. Levi's rational inquirer can be content to maintain a static belief state, for he knows the only potential criticism comes when he decides to revise. Of course, revision may be forced upon him by quotidian interaction with the world. One's belief state is constantly updated involuntarily by way of one's perceptual input. These updates require maintenance using the same principles of revision. But there is no mechanism, in Levi's system, for initiating inquiry. In the epistemic logic framework, the presentation of a proposition as input to the revision of an information state is an non-rational process.

Peirce recognized that no human agent will be content to stand pat with their knowledge. "The iritation of doubt causes a struggle to attain a state of belief," and this iritation is "the only immediate motive for the struggle to attain belief" {% include appendices/ref.html id="peirce1877" o="" p="10" e="." %} While such iritation is a natural state for human inquirers, our current framework has no means of accounting for the conditions under which a rational agent chooses to scratch.

William James {% include appendices/ref.html id="james1896" o="" %} carried this idea further, drawing a distinction between two independent and sometimes conflicting goals for those engaged in the pursuit of knowledge. One is, as Levi suggests, to avoid believing falsehoods, but another, equally important one, is to acquire true beliefs.  A clever agent could meet the goal of avoiding falsehoods by simply believing nothing at all, but they would thereby forfeit the virtue of believing truths. One could, alternatively, meet the goal of believing truths simply by believing everything, but doing so sacrifices entirely achieving the second goal. As James saw it, a strategy of inquiry that floats between these extremes is the path we ought to search for. This suggests that the need for revision is not merely an incidental consequence of our inquisitive minds. It is, instead, an ocassional mandate of proper inquiry that the agent *strive* to believe truths, even if doing so risks importing error.

James famously argued that if one's belief choice is *live*, *momentous*, and *forced*, then the will to believe rationally outstrips the fear of being wrong. But as a set of necessary requirements, this restricts speculative endeavors too much. Inquiry need not be momentous or forced for jumping to a conclusion to be epistemically fruitful. Mere time-sensitivity may be enough. Inquiry is a process that is undertaken by fallible individuals in real time. Such agents have limited access to information and limited resources to dedicate to the process of inquiry. Frequently, action is required before certainty can be obtained. And on many quotidian decision points, the risk of being incorrect is fairly low. It is *because* not every inquiry is momentous that striving for truth (and risking falsehood) is sometimes to be prefered. Let us call this extended conception of the rational development of inquiry the *Jamesian amendment*.

<!-- Jamesian amendment -->
{% assign jamesianamendment = site.data.definitions["jamesian amendment"] %}
{% include examples/def.html type="def" term="Jamesian amendment" defn=jamesianamendment %}

The Jamesian amendment makes inquiry an optimization task between taking on too many falsehoods and leaving out too many truths. To accommodate this idea, we need to expand our structural representation of inquiry. The information state model from epistemic logic can account for the error-avoidance goal. But we need a way of representing two elements entailed by the goal of acquiring truth. The first is the *impetus to revise* -- information state structure that captures an inquirer's motivation to strive for knowledge. The second is the *will to believe* -- an account of acceptance of a belief in the absence of certainty in its truth, and an explanation of how this maneuver can be rationally viable.[^informationpotential]

#### Impetus to revise

To have a call for revision of one's information state is to recognize an inadequacy therein. Inadequacies can be of the sort in which an agent *knows too much*, in the sense that their information state is contradictory and thereby contains too much information.[^knowtoomuch] The means of rectifying this sort of inadequacy is accommodated on the Levi model, in the form of conditions on contraction. While all information states are, for Levi, equal in terms of adequacy, we can set the trivial state aside as the one state that always demands revision, and in particular, revision by contraction out of epistemic hell.

Inadequacies can also arise when one acknowledges that they *know too little*, in the sense that there is an issue that is not settled by their state of information. This sort of inadequacy is not to be accommodated in Levi's model. As defined so far, information states are nothing more than their members, and each state (potentially) contains infinitely many points. Aside from the situation in which one state strictly contains another, there is no way of saying that one state is more informative than another.[^contain]

Recognition of information state incompleteness is a principal impetus to revise. For a state to represent itself as containing unsettled issues, we need to add structure to the information state. To have an unsettled issue is to have a non-uniformity across the information state with respect to a particular subject matter; certain points represent one resolution of the subject matter, other points a different resolution. Recognition of a non-uniform pattern holding across an information state can be modeled formally by means of a relation *R* defined over the membership of the information state, such that for any two elements of the state, *x* and *y*, *R(x,y)* just in case *x* and *y* agree on the subject matter of *R*. The effect is a partitioning of the information state into equivalence classes with respect to the issue that the agent's information state is unable to settle. The result is an information state that calls for revision, in particular, expansion by elimination of complete cells in the partition.

#### Will to believe

As it currently stands, our model of inquiry allows for propositions to be incorporated into information states in two ways. They can be consequences of evidence the agent acquires through their observational faculties, or they can be entailed by other propositions that are themselves consequences of such evidence. It follows from the Jamesian amendment that a rational inquirer may, at times, be warranted in taking on belief that is not conclusively established by either of these means. But we could easily incorporate this mandate, without modifying the structure of inquiry at all, by loosening the requirement for when a proposition counts as a consequence of an agent's evidence. The most natural constraint involves restricting our evidence to direct observation, but there is nothing in principle from incorporating propositions that merely have the *balance of reasons* tilted in their favor.

The problem with this proposal is the threat it poses to the first epistemic goal of error-avoidance. Once a belief is incorporated into an information state, it can be difficult to excise. And as more beliefs become incorporated, tracing the countours of their relative entrenchment becomes exceedingly tedious. It is granted that the will to believe carries a risk of being wrong. Information states must be insured against this risk, and simply reducing entry requirements for membership in the information state does not provide any assurance.

Additionally, we can here grant Levi's point that there does seem to be a difference between the two cognitive goals. It isn't a difference in significance to the inquiry, but it does provide us with reason to represent differently the incorporation of propositions stemming from the two goals.

James' characterization of the motivation for the will to believe emphasizes that it is the *choice* that is genuine and calls for resolution. The essence of the genuine choice is that no particular resolution of the uncertainty demands selection, but still a selection must be made. We can capture this feature of proposition integration via the will to believe by focusing on the selected proposition's position within the partition we introduced to capture the impetus to revise. The will to believe is nothing more than selecting a prefered resolution of a recognized incompleteness in one's information state. Formally, this amendment requires only that the relation *R* that represents the partition impose an *order* on the members of the state. The result is an information state that both calls for revision and selects a preferred means of doing so. And it does so while insulating the information state from the risk the revision carries.

{% include examples/def.html type="explic" term="Levi on goal generated constraints" sent="Example" sub="Sub-example" defn=levi %}

This extension of inquiry based on the Jamesian amendment is intended to capture the abductive phase of inquiry. The two parts of the extension happen to map onto a commonly cited distinction within the abductive phase {% include appendices/ref.html id="campos2011,shanahan1986" o="n" e="." %} *Creative abduction* is associated with the scientific context of discovery. It is involved when an inquirer recognizes a scientifically fruitful question and develops a set of hypotheses that serve as potential answers to that question. Incompleteness, modeled as a partition on an information state, represents the output of creative abduction. The extension does not provide us, specifically, with an account of the conditions under which an agent comes to represent its own incompleteness. And this is all to the good, for creative abduction is notoriously unamenable to logical characterization. We don't have, nor do we want, a topic-neutral story of revision into incompleteness. But the extension does provide a uniform representation of what a state that *calls for* revision looks like.

The second part captures the value of *striving* for truth, which closely resembles the *selective* phase of abduction, in which the scientist chooses from amongst the set of viable hypotheses the one that best answers the question on the basis of a set of criteria that perhaps don't eliminate all other answers completely. This is the mode of reasoning known as *inference to the best explanation*. James' proposal was that, ocassionally, elimination of incompleteness is rationally preferred to remaining ambivalent even at the risk of being wrong.

Modeling inquiry in this way thus makes it part of the domain of logic to specify the conditions under which this selective abduction is warranted. What makes it the case that it is epistemically appropriate to risk importing error into one's information state? I contend that the rationality of such a maneuver is secured by specific *corrective procedures* embedded in the process of proper inquiry. These procedures are the domain of the inductive phase.

For the deductive phase, the motivation for the structural posit was the error-avoidance goal of proper inquiry. The justification for the specific properties of the revision operator is done piecemeal by way of a demonstration that each rule of expansion or contraction preserves truth.

But the motivation for the structural posits necessary to capture the abductive phase -- the Jamesian amendment -- changes the game entirely. Demonstration is not the proper method of justification for a solution to an optimization problem. In its place, we want two things: (i) assurance that each criterion secured to a high degree, and (ii) insurance that success on each criterion is insulated against success on the others. As applied to the Jamesian amendment to the nature of inquiry, the first condition is met by reliability testing on the outputs of the selective abductive phase. To the extent that the inquirer tends to settle on true hypotheses, her process of inquiry is well calibrated. The second condition requires that striving for truth acquisition does not radically undermine the goal of error avoidance. To meet this, our account of inquiry must incorporate protective insurance against the wanton incorporation of error in the course of the abductive phase. This, I contend, is provided by conditions of *coherence* and *collaboration* to which proper inquiry is subject. These conditions provide a corrective mechanism against error introduction, and this mechanism is in the jurisdiction of the *inductive* phase of inquiry.

### Induction

Induction is normally understood in Peirce's tripartite distinction as an ampliative mode of reasoning in which an inference is made about unobserved items on the basis of observed ones. It is the reasoning involved when one generalizes from facts about a sample to facts about the entire population {% include appendices/ref.html id="sep-peirce" o="n" e="." p="Sect. 3" %} For familiar Humean reasons, it is unclear that a complete specification of the nature of and a foundational account of the justification of its outputs will be forthcoming. But in another guise, inductive reasoning is the process involved in the scientific testing phase, whereby hypotheses are subjected to empirical investigation, and data is accumulated for the purposes of evaluating the relative success of the various hypotheses. This data is then used as input in the selective abduction phase.

<!-- Van Fraassen's first way -->
{% assign vffw = site.data.definitions["van fraassen's first way"] %}
{% include examples/def.html type="def" term="Van Fraassen's First Way" defn=vffw %}

I want to explore the function of induction under its scientific testing guise. Of particular interest is how we can incorporate the virtue of testing as a corrective procedure for the flights of fancy introduced in the abductive phase.

As mentioned above, rational inquirers with finite cognitive capacities have an incentive to form beliefs in the absence of certainty. A preference for belief in the face of uncertainty is further supported by the fact that inquiries are packaged with corrective feedback mechanisms. An important such mechanism is the build-and-test update procedure that inquiry exhibits. Inquiries are cummulatively built in a step by step process. A contribution to the inquiry adds a proposal to an inquiry workspace, making it available to be played around with by subsequent contributions to the inquiry before being ultimately accepted or rejected.

The Levi model sees the process of inquiry as a binary relation between states of information. We can import information about the genesis of a sentence during the revision phase, and use this to determine whether a sentence deserves entry or retention in our information state. But once the revision takes place, all that information is lost. All sentences in an information state have the same infallible status. It is as if the information state was formed from whole cloth.

But once we open the door to incorporating the goal of truth acquisition into our representation of inquiry, we see inquiry as a *dilated process*. Inter-revision states are not complete states of knowledge. Instead, they are way stations on the road to knowledge. Viewing inquiry as a dilated process provides us with additional properties by which to evaluate the quality of inquiries. Proper inquiry, as a dilated process, involves *coherence* among its contributions. Part of that coherence is that contributions to the inquiry respond appropriately to prior contributions, where appropriateness is judged in terms of the contribution's capacity for bringing us to the end of inquiry.

#### Coherence

Rational, dilated processes are governed by a system of structural constraints -- a *plan* for the process. Proposed moves in the process are evaluated in terms of how they fit within the governing plan. The primary function of a plan is to restrict the set of possibilities from amongst which those engaged in the process select their moves. This imposed restriction allows plans to be followed, in real time, by cognitively limited agents. But plans are also to be carried out in real space, which does not always evolve the way planning agents hope or expect. Too rigid a restriction on possible moves will bind the agents to failure. Thus, plans must allow for modification in the face of unexpected developments in the environment within which the process takes place.

<!-- Bratman extra -->

{% endcapture %}
{% include examples/def.html type="explic" term="Bratman et al. on plans" sent="Example" sub="Sub-example" defn=bratman %}

Proper inquiry is no different. A plan of inquiry imposes *coherence* constraints on contributions to the inquiry. Future additions must follow the general course set by previous contributions. But, nature can so conspire to turn certain conjectures into dead ends, and a healthy plan of inquiry will accommodate mechanisms to adjust the plan on the fly.

#### Collaboration

Testing as a corrective procedure is something that a solitary inquirer can take on themselves. But its value is most evident in the context of joint inquiry. The primary role of joint inquiry is to expedite what would be an extremely tedious task if attempted alone. The truth acquisition goal of inquiry, modeled within the abductive phase, can be viewed as an efficiency mechanism. Judicious speculation can be a shortcut in the difficult trek through a vast intellectual terrain. The collaborative facet of joint inquiry provides extra motivation for assuming the risk such shortcuts involve -- the collaborative interlocutor, to the extent she is able, will pull you back from the ledge by voicing her *disagreement*. Disagreement is the tool by which interlocutors can check each other's flights of fancy. It is a tool that rational inquirers both know how to wield and are prepared to let others weild against them.

The success of this procedure depends heavily on a shared understanding of each party's role in the inquiry. An individual can only feel comfortable in proposing a speculative addition to the common ground if they believe that their collaborators will correct their contribution to the best of their ability.  And this requires interlocutors to be more than passive recipients of information.  They must use openings in the conversation to interject disapproval or uncertainty in addition to registering understanding and acceptance of what has been presented.

In proper inquiry, it is not enough that the participants in the inquiry come to accept truths about the world. The process of inquiry, when faithfully undertaken serves to provide its participants with justification for coming to accept the outputs of the process. Having gone through the inquiry is also necessary for the right to believe its outputs. John Stuart Mill's {% include appendices/ref.html id="mill1859" o="" %} defense of liberty centrally relies on the corrective value of dispute in proper inquiry. Even in the face of certainty regarding the answer to certain questions, dispute plays an important role in sustaining individual community members' right to believe the accepted truth.

This makes one's right to believe dependent upon the interlocutors with whom one interacts. Not only are asserters expected to be able to provide reasons for the propositions they propose, hearers are expected to challenge assertions when their content contradicts either their own expectations, or the shared conversational record.

These commitments of cooperative exchange are realized in certain discourse mechanisms. The hearer has tools at her disposal for challenging assertion.  Primary among these is flat out denial, but often it is not maximally cooperative to flatly deny an assertion for this response has the effect of derailing the progress of the inquiry, and it is too sweeping in its effect.  Utterances involve a great number of parts, any of which may be subject to criticism, but criticizing one part may leave others unscathed.  Thus, hearers also have means for correcting utterances without issuing a blanket denial.

Mill's model of inquiry makes collaboration essential to the process. It is not just that individuals can make use of each other to acquire true beliefs about the world. Earning the right to those beliefs requires individuals to work together, and it foists commitments upon each party: speakers must be ready to defend their claims and hearer's must be prepared to correct claims when they can.

For Mill, it was essential to the justification of beliefs that they withstand continual attack from those who disagree with them. That is, for an individual to justifiably maintain a particular belief, they must be capable of defending that belief against attack from potential, reasonable dissenters. Even stronger, they must actually defend the belief against actual, reasonable dissenters. Marc Moffett {% include appendices/ref.html id="moffett2007" o="" %} has suggested that this criterion of individual justified belief is tantamount to what he calls the collective criticism condition, which demands "free and open critical discussion" of beliefs among epistemic peers who hold countervailing beliefs. We thus derive a principle of social epistemics from a principle of individual level justification of belief.

If the process of inquiry is what provides individual level belief justification, then the process of inquiry must make room for the collective criticism condition. It is my contention that natural discourse does just this. Not only are asserters expected to be able to provide reasons for the propositions they propose, hearers are expected to challenge assertions when their content contradicts either their own expectations, or the shared conversational record.

These commitments of cooperative exchange are realized in certain discourse mechanisms. The hearer has certain tools at her disposal for challenging assertion. Primary among these is flat out denial, but often it is not maximally cooperative to flatly deny an assertion for this response has the effect of derailing the progress of the inquiry, and it is too sweeping in its effect. Involve a great number of parts, any of which may be subject to criticism, but criticizing one part may leave others unscathed. Thus, hearers also have means for correcting utterances without issues a blanket denial.

This account of justification is an internalist one. Hearers must be aware of their commitment in securing justification for the speaker, and the speaker must be aware that the hearer is so aware in order to retain genuine warrant for her assertion. (Presumably, this mutual awareness could be iterated indefinitely.) The presence of this mutual awareness of each participant's role in generating justification suggests that not only does the hearer respond to the speaker's proposal, but also that the speaker's proposal will anticipate the hearer's response. Assertions represent, in addition to the content put forward, their anticipation of potential challenges to that content. Call this the corrective potential of an assertion.

The proposal here is that speaker and hearer contributions form a discourse pair, each of which both depends on and puts constraints on the other. A consequence of this model of discourse is that one can get insight into the deep structure of an utterance by looking to the nature of its discourse pair.

A well established application of this idea can be found in the alternative semantics for focus interpretation. It was found that focus placement in responses to questions easily predictable. And the semantic contribution of focus in an utterance matches that of the question to which the utterance is a fellicitous response.

#### Revision history

Dilated inquiry is a collaborative effort, either between different inquirers working together, or a single inquirer working on past progress at a later time. Viable use of the inquiry over the course of time (with different contributors) requires an ability to track the changes the inquiry imposes on the information state.  That is, we need a *revision history*.

Inquiry is not a monotonic process. It moves in starts and spurts. The impetus to revise occassionaly moves the information state into a problematic position, which can only be recognized as needing remedy later on. Remedy requires revision, but there are an infinite number of ways to revise. Directed revision requires a *revision history*.

Knowledge is not, as Levi suggests, merely infallible belief. It requires inter-revision justification. Knowledge requires an account. This too is represented in inquiry (here, I'm flipping the grounding order). Inquiry carries a *revision history*, by way of treating structuring updates as relations-in-intension, instead of directly imposing the structure on the information state.

### Advancing the inquiry

A conjecture is a kind of conversational move. It is defined in terms of the role it plays in advancing the inquiry in which it occurs. While speech acts are finely individuated, there is a small set of {% include appendices/word.html word='contribution' %} types derivable from the goals of inqury.[^ConversationalForce]

The primary goal of inquiry is to come to know something one did not know at its outset. Thus, an individual can advance us toward that goal by submitting (proposing) information to be taken on as mutually accepted. We call this kind of contribution an {% include appendices/word.html word='assertion.' %}

The end point of an inquiry depends in part on its starting point, which is the *issue* that is to be resolved by the process of inquiry. An individual can submit a new issue to the inquiry to be taken on as providing a new goal for the inquiry.  We call this contribution a {% include appendices/word.html word='question' %}.[^command][^mood]

These commonly cited examples do not provide an exhaustive list of conceptually possible contribution types. I don't intend to provide identity conditions for types of contribution, but the examples do share certain things in common, and their common traits can provide us with criteria for recognizing novel contribution types.

+ Genuine contribution types *operate on* {% include appendices/word.html word='*information*' %} in a distinctive way. Assertions expand the context set, and questions partition it. The currency of inquiry is information, and its value is tied to the ways in which information can be put to use to advance the inquiry toward its goal.
+ Conversational moves that contribute to inquiry *anticipate an appropriate response*, and *place constraints on the form of the response*. Assertion anticipates either acceptance or rejection of the asserted content, and (modulo repair tactics for failed presuppositions) restricts responses to either acceptance or rejection. Questions anticipate an answer, and restrict responses to those assertions that at least partially resolve the issue raised.[^QACongruence]
+ Genuine contribution types are performed by way of a *conventionalized linguistic tool*. If a contribution belongs to a specific type, language will have found a way to implement that type. Assertions and questions are stronly tied to linguistic mood, although the connection between these contribution types and mood is a tricky one {% include appendices/ref.html id="portner1997,starr2010" o="n" e="." %}

I maintain that conjecture, when paired with a corresponding correction, constitutes a distinct, genuine contribution type. Conjecture is similar to assertion in that it seems to provide a proposal of added information. And similarly to questions, conjectures seem to present an issue that is up for further discussion.[^supposition] But conjectures are distinct from each of these, and call for a unique treatment.  That they earn such status is what I hope to show throughout the course of this project.

## Knowledge and knowing (What do we know?)

Call the result the *inquiry-first* account of knowledge. The object of knowledge is the output of proper inquiry -- a collaboratively developed structure composed of (at least) a possibility space, a set of relations over that space, and a record of the process by which the issue has been resolved. This is a fairly substantial departure from the standard view of knowledge on which it is a relation that holds between an individual and a proposition. But substantial doesn't mean radical, and the proposal is not as divorced from common sense as it may at first seem.

### Solitary knowing

If one does not belong to a community of inquirers, then the notion of defending one's contributions makes little practical sense. Still, the hermit and non-social animals possess knowledge; the *Collective criticism condition* threatens to cut too deeply. Despite this initial worry, the inquiry-first account has no difficulty accounting for solitary knowledge.

First, the account requires only that the knower possess the *ability* to defend her beliefs, whether or not they have come under actual threat.[^ability] The hermit can be capable of defending his beliefs were anyone to venture into his hollow, and non-social animals may possess the concepts required by the inquiry-first account though they lack the tools to express them verbally.

Second, the account commits the knower only to defending belief against the *best available* arguments, and in degenerative cases, these arguments may not be all that good. It follows from this qualification that knowledge is relativized to external factors such as the existence of an engaged community poised to challenge belief. Externalization of the conditions required for knowledge is significant, but not unmotivated. Consider the classic cases of external defeaters in the post-Gettier epistemology literature. Gilbert Harman's *library detective* case will do {% include appendices/ref.html id="harman1973" o="n" e=":" %}[^goldman]

> In front of the library detective, Tom takes a library book from the shelf and hides it in his coat. He then walks out of the library without renting it and brazenly flaunts it outside. The library detective sees all of this and reports it to the police. The library detective is confident that it is Tom who stole the book.
>
> Later, Tom's mother testifies that Tom has a twin brother who has a naughty streak, and Tom could not have taken the book because he is actually thousands of miles away. The library detective does not hear this testimony. Tom's mother is lying, and it was Tom who took the book.

Spurious as it is, the testimony having been made is intuitively enough to defeat the library detective's knowledge. The fact that this defeater is unavailable to the library detective is of no consequence to his knowledge. The *Collective criticism condition* captures this intuition by building the record of challenges addressed into the object of knowledge. Until the library detective is accorded an opportunity to defend his charge against Tom's mother's rebuttal, his inquiry is incomplete, and knowledge eludes him.

Similar remarks can be made on behalf of the knowledge of non-social animals. The less developed the inquisitiveness of one's community is, the less refined one's knowledge will be. But it will be markedly easier to obtain and hold on to. Membership in an actively inquiring community helps one to discover more than they could on their own, but it also makes it more difficult to obtain knowledge of the investigated issue. This contextual sensitivity of knowledge, it seems to me, accurately captures the way we think about intellectual achievement.

### Knowing the truth

Timothy Williamson {% include appendices/ref.html id="williamson2000" o="" p="21-48" %} argues that knowledge is a state of mind. His primary concern is to defend the attribution of mentality against those who maintain that knowledge is factorizable into a narrow, belief-centric mental state and a wide, truth-based connection to the world. But in light of the inquiry-first perspective, it is relevant also to challenge his attribution of statehood. Inquiries evolve, and their self-referential proclivities require the entire evolution to be available to the inquirers. This suggests that the output of the process of inquiry is itself a dilated process. Thus, knowledge is a complex, mental process.

This consequence is immediately worrisome. It would be nice if the form of knowledge ascribing sentences revealed the structure of the knowledge relation. Since the canonical knowledge ascription has a sentential complement clause in the object position, it seems to follow that the object of knowledge has sentential form. It seems, further, to be a basic feature of knowledge ascriptions that they are *factive*, which is to say that they always embed truths in their complement clause. Putting all this together, a simple candidate to be the object of knowledge is any true proposition. Processes are not propositions; thus, we worry.

To the extent that knowledge ascriptions must embed truths,[^factivity] all that is required is that the object of the referenced knowledge relation *determine* a truth. While processes are not themselves truth-apt, they are complexes that contain truth-apt elements, and they can be *queried* at various stages of their development. To do so is to pull out a relevant slice of the process, culling the information it contains both in terms of time and in terms of its structural scope. The result of the query on an inquiry is an *information state*. According to the inquiry-first perspective, the function of knowledge ascriptions is to perform a query on an inquiry specifically for a truth it contains at a time.[^refinement]

Importantly, though, not all knowledge ascriptions are canonical. A variety of putative attributions of knowledge do not have, on their surface, sentential complement clauses, which indicates that they do not embed propositional objects.

<!-- Varieties of knowledge -->
{% include examples/ex.html term="varieties of knowledge" type="sent" %}

Surface appearances aren't always the whole story; perhaps a proper filling out will include cameos by propositions lurking under the surface {% include appendices/ref.html id="stanley2001" o="n" e="." %} But sometimes the best guide to what there is is exactly what appearances tell us; in the case of knowledge ascriptions, it appears that an individual's knowledge can subsume more than just propositional information {% include appendices/ref.html id="bengson2012a,grzankowski2012" o="n" e="." %} [^intellectualism]

The inquiry-first perspective on knowledge offers a pleasing account of this diversity amongst knowledge ascriptions. As we'll see in [Discourse as collaborative update](/chapters/discourse-as-collaborative-update.html), a plausible representation of inquiry at the logical level includes *discourse referents* as elements of the inquiry structure. It is possible to treat knowledge ascriptions in their *personal* guise as querying an inquiry for these objects. And the structural approach to inquiry provides a framework for similarly representing the entities (*ways*, or some other concept/property) needed as objects for knowledge ascriptions in their procedural guise.

By unifying the varieties of knowledge -- treating them as different queries on the same process -- we get a pleasing explanation of this corner of mentality {% include appendices/ref.html id="kitcher1989" o="n" e="." %} Rather than positing distinct kinds of knowledge {% include appendices/ref.html id="grzankowski2012" o="n" e="," %} or risking loss by attempting to reduce one type of knowledge to another {% include appendices/ref.html id="sinhababu2015" o="n" e="," %} we are provided with a single object of knowledge that can accommodate the full variety of ways that such knowledge can be ascribed.

We also get to avoid contorting surface form of knowledge ascriptions in interpreting them.

<!-- Conjunctive knowledge -->
{% include examples/ex.html term="conjunctive knowledge" type="sent" %}

The inquiry-first perspective on knowledge treats ascriptions such as that in [Conjunctive knowledge](#conjunctive-knowledge) as posing a conjunctive query on an inquiry being carried out by the subject. Since the inquiry is a single complex process containing both objectual and propositional elements, we need only make one call to the inquiry and have it return a single information state. This is directly represented in the surface form of the ascription. An approach that treats personal knowledge as a distinct relation from propositional knowledge must appeal to elided material in the deep structure of the conjunctive ascription. An approach that attempts to reduce personal knowledge to propositional knowledge has already given up the game of respecting surface structure, positing additional, unvoiced material even in atomic knowledge ascriptions.

## The value of knowledge

In the *Meno*, Socrates offers a demonstration that any value one accrues by possessing knowledge rather than merely true belief is not provided by its practical benefits.

> **Socrates:** Let me explain. If someone knows the way to Larissa, or anywhere else you like, then when he goes there and takes others with him he will be a good and capable guide, you would agree?
>
> **Meno:** Of course.
>
> **Socrates:** But if a man judges correctly which is the road, though he has never been there and doesn't know it, will he not also guide others aright?
>
> **Meno:** Yes, he will.
>
> **Socrates:** Therefore true opinion is as good a guide as knowledge for the purpose of acting rightly. (97a-b)

In terms of its contribution to successful action, which seems to be a primary motivation for knowledge acquisition, true belief fits the bill no worse. Still, it seems clear that knowledge *is* better in some way than the corresponding merely true belief. Determining the nature of this added benefit is the *epistemic value problem*.

As proposal for grounding the value differential, Socrates likens mere true opinion to a statue sculpted by Daedalus. Both tend to fly away from their possessor, and their value is similarly limited as a result. The added value of possessing knowledge comes from the fact that it is tied down by an *account*. He admits, though, that a full theory of knowledge eludes him.

> **Socrates:** Well of course, I have only been using an analogy myself, not knowledge. But it is not, I am sure, a mere guess to say that right opinion and knowledge are different. There are few things that I should claim to know, but that at least is among them, whatever else it is. (98b)

I think that Socrates proposal for what separates knowledge from true belief is basically correct. I hope in this section to show how, from the inquiry-first perspective, knowledge as belief tied down by an account has more than just analogy on its side.

### Belief stability

Meno's first stab at an answer to Socrates' probing regarding the value of possessing knowledge is a pretty good one. He suggests that the knower is better off than the fortunately successful believer because the knower will successfully navigate her way to Larissa *every time*.

> **Socrates:** So right opinion is something no less useful than knowledge.
>
> **Meno:** Except that the man with knowledge will always be successful, and the man with right opinion only sometimes.
>
> **Socrates:** What? Will he not always be successful so long as he has the right opinion?

Socrates rightfully points out that, holding belief constant across times, she too will never fail to arrive at Larissa. But belief needn't be constant, and a more charitable reading of Meno's answer is that the value of knowledge is in providing an agent with greater belief *stability* than that accruing to mere true belief.

Timothy Williamson {% include appendices/ref.html id="williamson2000" o="" p="62" %} suggests a similar line to this reading of Meno:

> A burglar spends all night ransacking a house, risking discovery by staying so long. We ask what features of the situation when he entered the house led to that result. A reasonable answer is that he knew that there was a diamond in the house. To say just that he believed truly that there was a diamond in the house would be to give a worse explanation, one whose explanans and explanandum are less closely connected. For one possibility consistent with the new explanans is that the burglar entered the house with a true belief that there was a diamond in it derived from false premises. For example, his only reason for believing that there was a diamond in the house might have been that someone told him that there was a diamond under the bed, when in fact the only diamond was in a drawer. He would then very likely have given up his true belief that there was a diamond in the house on discovering the falsity of his belief that there was a diamond under the bed, and abandoned the search.

Knowledge stabilizes belief; this, it explains why individuals persist in their belief, even in the face of misleading defeaters. The suggestion is that knowledge is valuable (in part) because it grounds explanations of behavior.  Value, though, is always value *for* somebody, and the intuition that drives the epistemic value problem is that possessing knowledge is more valuable *for it possessor*. The appeal to the burglar's knowledge as an explanation of his ransacking the house all night may, perhaps, be of use to a detective investigating the robbery after the fact. But explanation of the sort in evidence in Williamson's case is of no value to the burglar. Granted, since he knows that the diamonds are in the house, his belief will be stable, even in the event that his search under the bed leaves him empty handed. But now, the moral of Meno's initial response to Socrates appears at a higher level. His knowledge that the diamonds are in the house is only of use to the burglar (and therefore valuable to him) *so long as he retains it*. Though the truth and justification of his knowledge are not in doubt, his continued belief in it is. To the extent that the burglar reflectively continues his search, it will be on the basis of his confidence in the source of his belief that the diamonds are in the house. His purported knowledge is not enough to turn the trick -- he also needs to have *access* to that knowledge. In other words, the epistemic value problem imposes an *internalist* constraint on knowledge.[^internalism]

### Cognitive virtue

Truth is of basic epistemic value, but it isn't clear that it is the only value relevant to knowledge. Ernest Sosa {% include appendices/ref.html id="sosa2003" o="" %} posits four distinct types of value involved in an individual possessing a bit of knowledge.

<!-- Types of value -->
{% capture valk %}
{% include appendices/typology.html distinction="value of knowledge" biblio="no" %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include examples/def.html type="table" term="Value of knowledge typology" defn=valk %}

*Success* is the fundamental epistemic value, but it does not exhaust the value to which the knower can lay claim. The *praxis* values, too, are genuine values. We think of a system that brings about knowledge as better than a similar system that fails to do so. But praxical value is parasitic on *success* value, both in the sense that it does not exist absent success, and that it adds no value for the knower that is not already provided by success. We, as third parties, can praise a system -- or the agent who implements that system -- for succeeding well. But, having so succeeded, the agent gets nothing more out of having done it well. Performance value seems to gain indepenedence from success, in that it is a measure of the dispositions of a belief forming system, and a disposition can be present even in the absence of its stimulus conditions. The performance value *for* the knower, though, is similarly nothing beyond that provided by success. Having witnessed success, the knower gets little else in knowing that we would also have praised him had the world so conspired to make his belief false.

The additional value associated with knowledge, as nice as they may be for an evaluation of the world, are practically irrelevant for the knower. The intuition that drives the epistemic value problem -- the one that is behind Meno's initial response -- is that possessing knowledge makes a difference to a believer's life.[^epiphenomenalvalue]

Of course, receiving praise can be of benefit to the believer, in a way that potentially goes beyond having achieved success. Praise breeds recognition, which leads others to seek one out as a source. Being known as a successful inquirer increases one's opportunity for engaging in inquiry, which in turn builds one's knowledge base. Knowledge is a principle example of success breeding success. Perhaps what is valuable about knowledge is not that it is *worthy* of praise, but simply that it is praised.

### Machines and products

Linda Zagzebski {% include appendices/ref.html id="zagzebski2003" o="" %} suggests that the epistemic value problem is especially acute for what she calls *machine-product* accounts of knowledge, on which knowledge is taken to be a state that is the output of some state generating process. Principal among these are *reliabilist* accounts of justification, whereby a belief is justified on the basis of the nature of the process that brings the belief about. Knowledge has justified belief as a component, and justified belief comes from belief forming processes that reliably produce true beliefs. But possessing a reliably formed true belief does one nothing that is not provided by possession of any old true belief.

> True belief arising from cognitive activity cannot be like espresso coming out of an espresso maker. Not only is the reliability of the machine insufficient to make the coffee in the cup any better; nothing about the machine makes the product any better. So if knowledge is true belief that is made better by something, knowledge cannot be the external product of the believer in the way the cup of espresso is the external product of the machine. {% include appendices/ref.html id="zagzebski2003" o="n" p="15" %}

What is it about knowledge being an external product of a believer that renders impossible any attempt to produce an unswamped epistemic value? Reliabilist accounts are external in a couple different ways. Reliabilist accounts are *externalist* in that a belief can be justified even though the believing agent does not have access to the souce of the belief. But this externalist element of these accounts is not the source of the worry, because internalist accounts that interpret the difference between justified and merely true belief in terms of *truth-conduciveness* also submit to the value problem. Once truth is achieved, truth-conduciveness provides nothing extra. Zagzebski directly addresses Lawrence Bonjour's approach to justification.

Reliabilist accounts are also *extrinsic* in that the justification inferring property is distinct from the belief it produces. Zagzebski seems to think that extrinsicness is the diagnosis of the value problem for reliabilism, but modal accounts show this isn't the case. The problem is that truth is a powerful value, and it's difficult to find another practical value that doesn't simply reduce to that.

### Justifying processes

But the problem isn't with the machine-product model itself. The problem has to do with the nature of the product. The solution is to imbue the product with the credit deserving feature --  the *account* of the state's genesis. Doing so injects the process into the product.

This only gets us part of the way. There is still an issue with the *unity* of knowledge. Why don't we still have a swamping issue, just now with one part of knowledge swamping the value provided by another part? Many parts would be so swamped, but the process as part is different because it provides independent, practical value.

Knowledge isn't just valuable because with it you arrive at Larissa. It is valuable because you can explain your route to others.

Knowledge queries inquiry, and the query encodes the process of inquiry. The individual beliefs abstracted from the state are known, but they are not the knowledge in so far as knowledge is value additive.

Knowledge is belief with an account. It is useful because having an account can assist you in an inquiry, and this has practical value. The process is valuable; it is included as part of the knowledge, we do get something of genuine practical value.

## Contextualism and relativism

If Brisco and Green both believe that they've got the culprit, then they will act in similar ways. They'll look to elicit a confession, offer up bargains, or threaten physical violence. But if Brisco's suspect is in confession room A while Green's is in B, then their actions will have quite different import.[^brisco] In one sense, Brisco and Green believe the same thing, but in another sense, they believe differently.

The fact that sameness of belief is two-sided in this way is brought out in the differences between a relativist and a contextualist approach to attitude ascriptions such as *Brisco believes that the culprit acted alone*. Relativists take belief to be a relation to a property -- one that a person stands in when she self-ascribes that property.[^centeredworlds] The agreement between Brisco and Green then comes from their both self-ascribing the property of *currently interrogating the culprit*. Their disagreement comes from the fact that Brisco self-ascribes the property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room A* and Green self-ascribes the property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room B*. Since individual people don't co-locate, they can't both possess their respective properties in actuality.

The contextualist views the situation differently. Belief, for the contextualist, is a relation between an individual and a proposition. But context infects the relation as well, and the relations one bears to a proposition need not be stable across changes in context.[^contextualistflavor] So, Brisco and Green definitely disagree.  Hold the context fixed, and Brisco stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room A*, while Green stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room B*. Since individual people don't co-locate, they cannot both, in actuality, believe true things. But, it may yet *appear* that they agree. After all, both Brisco and Green would honestly tell the Liutenant "I'm subjecting the culprit to interrogation." But the contextualist denies that honest reporting tells the whole story. Our words are sensitive to context in a way that our beliefs are not. Their espousal of the same belief is merely superficial.

The difference is one way of cashing out the difference between relativist and contextualist views of attitudes. But this is not the only way.

### Disagreement as lingusitic data

Disagreement has been a bit of a star figure in recent debates in the philosophy of language. Primarily, it has been used as a tool for assessing the adequacy of different proposals for the semantic contribution of certain expressions. The contestants in battle disagreement are *absolutism*, *contextualism*, and *relativism*, and the standard scorecard has absolutism and relativism coming out on top in virtue of their ability to secure constant content across uses of the expression. Genuine disagreement does seem to require something toward which utterances can entail incompatible commitments, but semantic content is not the only contribution an utterance makes to discourse. Contextualism can appeal other elements of utterances, which may both remain constant and serve as the seat of disagreement.

### Commitment and contribution

Plunkett and Sundell

The difference between contextualism and relativism is generally couched in terms of content, but content is not the only semantically relevant element of linguistic utterances. Also associated with what we say is a context change potential. A different way of representing the difference between contextualism and relativism is not in terms of what they mean but what they do.

### The nature of relativism

John MacFarlane characterizes as relativistic any semantic theory that makes essential reference to the context of the <em>assessor</em> of an utterance. And much of the contextualism/relativism debate has centered on who's context matters. But Peter Lasersohn provided an interestingly different take on relativism. His support of relativism was not so much that certain expressions demand that the assessor's context be included but that whose context is important to evaluation is not <em>determined</em> at the point of utterance.

### Joint inquiry and relativism

Joint inquiry, modeled by sandbox-level investigation, suggests exactly this. An individuals utterance is incomplete in an important way, and it calls for completion from one's interlocutors. Thus, evaluation is delayed until the inquiry progresses.  Knowledge, it turns out, is relative; just not in the way we first suspected.

Belief is functionally tied to action, and Brisco and Green are acting in very similar ways. While Brisco is putting the screws to the guy in room A, Green has got the guy in room B under a hot lamp. They both have drafted warrant requests, and have finger prints running through the database checker.

    They are also similar to suppositions in that they seem to be less than fully committal on the part of the speaker. Assertion is generally associated with a commitment that it generates for the speaker.  This commitment involves some evidential relation between the asserter and the information conveyed, though it is controversial just what relation it is. But whatever the relation amounts to, it seems clear that we sometimes offer contributions to discourse that go beyond the evidence we have available.

    Each of these contribution types has an associated linguistic mood. Inquiry is a structured process, in which it is important not only what information is available but also how it is to be put to use in reaching the goal. As an implementation of inquiry, linguistic discourse has conventional means of representing how the information is being put to use by a contribution. But the scope of contribution types is not limited by the set of conventional moods. Nor do I think the concept of *linguistic mood* cuts along the same joints as that of *contribution type*. What is important for a contribution type is that there is a recognizably unique way in which information is put to use to further the goals of the inquiry.

    Virtue epistemological solutions, in so far as they posit a distinctive value possessed by knowledge, must also explain why not all knowledge is valuable. Sosa's {% include appendices/ref.html id="sosa2003" o="" %} example of the beachcomber who acquires knowledge of the number of grains of sand in his palm the hard way does not acquire something valuable. But he has knowledge just the same, and if there is a distinctive epistemic virtue, then his life ought to be better off for the counting.
