# From cooperation to collaboration via conjecture

{% include concept.html word='Discourse' %} can take a wide variety of forms, but academic study has been primarily concerned with the subclass of discourses that fall under the heading of *cooperative exchanges of information*.  These discourses involve two or more individuals engaged in a project of achieving the goal of increasing their mutual knowledge, using each other's stock of information to augment their own. In this form, discourse implements a jointly undertaken {% include concept.html word='inquiry.' %} An inquiry is, in the words of Robert Stalnaker, "the enterprise of forming, testing, and revising beliefs" {% include ref.html id="stalnaker1987" p='ix' e='.' %}

Discourse that implements a joint inquiry is {% include concept.html word='cooperative:' base='cooperation' %} A speaker offers a that is makes room for responses that she anticipates her {% include concept.html word='interloctors' base='interlocutor' %} are able to provide. A hearer considers the contribution, adds it to her personal model of the conversation, and adjusts her response to accord with the expanded model. And the process iterates with the discourse participants alternating roles, always trying to make their contribution fit with what has predeeded it. Paul Grice took his *cooperative principle*, "make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged," to be the one general principle by which participants in conversations derive the import of their {% include concept.html word="interlocutors'" base='interlocutor' %} utterances {% include ref.html id="grice1989" o="n" e="." %} But discourse isn't just cooperative in this sense -- it is {% include concept.html word="collaborative." base='collaboration' %}

You and I are set to build a stone wall. We have before us a pile of stones of various sizes, as well as mortar and wheel-barrows and other tools necessary for the job. Some of the stones are small enough for a single person to move into position. To productively add these stones to the wall, one of us need only recognize the positioning of previously laid stones and place the new stone next to them in a neat fashion. This requries that we *cooperate* with each other in our placement of smaller stones. But some of the stones are quite large; they require us both to lift in unison and carefully place into position on the wall. To get these stones in place, we must the willing to *collaborate* in our efforts. While placing these larger stones adds complication through the increased demand on coordination, the value of having such a stone in place is potentially great in minimizing the overall effort required to bring our wall building task to a close.

In many ways, inquiry is a similar endeavor to wall-building. {% include concept.html word="Information" base='information' %} takes the place of stones as the building blocks participants collectively heft, and utterances take the place of hands and wheelbarrows as the conveyances of the building materials. If all goes well, our analogy maps the finished wall to resolution of whatever {% include concept.html word='issues' base='issue' %} spurred our entering into the inquiry.

I think that conversation commonly realizes a collaborative inquiry, in the sense that successful contribution to the discourse requires the efforts of multiple parties working in concert, not just serially. It is the goal of this project to both motivate this idea and provide a model for how it is implemented. 

The principle departure point for the discussion is the speech act of {% include concept.html word='conjecture.' base='conjecture' %} In the course of conversation, individuals will ocassionally put forward information for which they do not possess conclusive evidence. Sometimes, the basis for such a maneuver is laziness, deceit, or obstinance. But often, this kind of move is just what the conversation needs to move forward. For instance, in brainstorming sessions, the scientific context of discovery, or tip-of-the-tongue style paralysis, discurrsants set aside the restriction that all contributions be considered to be accurate in favor of entering into the {% include concept.html word='conversational record' base='common ground' %} something that the parties can use as a jumping off point. In these situations, speculative informational profferments form an important part in advancing the inquiry. 

At its base, this common conversational move, a {% include concept.html word='conjecture,' %} is a distinctive kind of {% include concept.html word='speech act' %} in which the speaker offers up her content with a {% include concept.html word='world-directed,' %} but less than {% include concept.html word='assertoric,' base='assertion' %} force. But a conjecture does not advance the inquiry on its own. Putting forward information one does not stand behind as accurate risks muddling the inquiry unless it is taken as merely a jumping off point. A conjecture *calls out* for a response, and the contribution it makes is not complete until that response is made. 

A conjecture needs to be vetted, and the canonical response to a conjecture is a move that provides this -- a {% include concept.html word="correction." %} Corrections can take many forms, but they normally involve two parts, a *denial* of some portion of the information previously put forward and a *substitution* for the denied information. The conjecture lays a rough foundation, and the correction builds upon it.

The dual conversational moves of conjecture and correction are what I call a {% include concept.html word='discourse pair.' %} The key precept of collaborative discourse dynamics is that discourse pairs are the basic units by which {% include concept.html word="contributions" base="contribution" %} to the inquiry are made. That is, we do not represent the conjecturer and corrector as each providing indvidually complete and jointly cooperative contributions to the discourse. Instead, the conjecture/correction pair together contribute to the inquiry, but the parts are individually inert.

The project of using the notion of discourse pairs to develop and motivate a theory of collaborative {% include concept.html word='discourse dynamics' %} has 3 parts:

> **[Conceptual](#concept):** Deriving collaborative discourse from inquiry by way of knowledge. Inquiry is deeply collaborative, and via a mutual, conceptual connection to knowledge, so too is discourse.


> **[Theoretical](#theory):** Development of a deeply {% include concept.html word='collaborative' base='collaboration' %} account of discourse dynamics and a formal model of {% include concept.html word='conjectures' base='conjecture' %} and {% include concept.html word='corrections' base='correction' %} within the {% include concept.html word='update semantics' %} tradition.

> **[Practical](#practice):** Application of the collaborative framework to the phenomenon of {% include concept.html word='contrastive topic,' base='contrastive topic' %} implications of the collaborative model for the concept of linguistic {% include concept.html word='disagreement,' %} and the {% include concept.html word='contentualism' %} v. {% include concept.html word='relativism' %} debate in semantics.

# Knowledge in the image of inquiry {#concept}

It is tempting to maintain that truth is the end of inquiry. But it isn't truth itself that the inquirer is after; she seeks *recognition* and *acceptance* of the truth. The {% include concept.html word='end of inquiry' %} is being in some *cognitive* state with true propositions as its content.

C.S. Peirce, and others following in his wake, suggested that the most we can hope for at the end of inquiry is the *settlement of opinion*, for:
  
> "as soon as a firm belief is reached we are entirely satisfied, whether the belief be true or false. And it is clear that nothing out of the sphere of our knowlege can be our object, for nothing which does not affect the mind can be the motive for mental effort. The most that can be maintained is, that we seek for a belief that we shall *think* to be true. But we think each one of our beliefs to be true, and indeed, it is mere tautology to say so." (*The Fixation of Belief*, p. 11)
    
In response, we could take the pragmatist bait and insist that truth is the end of inquiry simply because whatever is output from the process of inquiry *just is* truth. But we needn't take this line. We can cleave to a correspondence account of truth while maintaining that final aim of inquiry involves {% include concept.html word='wide content' %} by delimiting a natural, restricted category of *proper* inquiry that can be reliably expected to result in true belief. 

Principally, proper inquiry is a rule governed process. Rule-following has the practical advantage of improving the reliability of the inquiry, but the connection to rule following is a conceptual one. The cognitive state that the inquirer seeks is *praiseworthy*, and one does not garner praise simply by stumbling onto true propositions. Undertaking the process of inquiry is important to earning the accolades that come with possessing the truth. Thus, the end of inquiry is a *normative*, cognitive state with true propositions as its content. Specifically, proper inquiry is a process that reliably produces justified, true belief. Modulo Gettier-type complications, the end of inquiry is *knowledge*.

If we had a solid understanding of the nature of knowledge, we could use the *end of* connection to extend our understanding to encompass inquiry as well. But the nature of knowledge is highly contested, and connections go both ways. I propose to investigate the basic structure of proper inquiry by looking to specific historical accounts of its importance, to take at face value the idea that the outputs of the process of inquiry are knowledge, and thereby to provide insight into the structure of the knowledge relation.

It will turn out along the way that this idea has important consequences for explaining the distinctive value of knowledge over true belief, and given broadly accepted connections between knowledge and discourse maneuvers, it also has implications for understanding the nature of discourse dynamics.

# Theoretical proof of concept for collaborative update {#theory}

Conjectures are best understood as one half of a pair of moves in a discourse. A contribution is incomplete without both parts being incorporated. In general, discourse pairs are completed by someone other than the one who initiates them. Thus, discourse pairs represent genuinely collaborative contributions to the inquiry. And it is a contribution that can be fruitfully modeled within a natural extension to the {% include concept.html word='update semantics' %} framework.

+ [Discourse &rarr; inquiry:](#contribution) Discourse realizes inquiry by way of conversational moves that advance the inquiry. Conversation advancing contributions are in gneral shared among multiple conversational participants.
+ [Collaborative update:](#update) Standard update semantics is build upon a framework of sequential additions to and operations on a shared {% include concept.html word='conversational space.' base='common ground' %} By supplementing this framework with a middle ground {% include concept.html word='working space,' base='sandbox' %} we can represent the {% include concept.html word='initiation' %} and {% include concept.html word='completion' %} phases of interlocutors working in parallel

## Advancing the inquiry {#contribution}

Accounting for conjecture constitutes an adequacy condition on semantic theory in that conjectures form a well-defined class of linguistic tools that do important interpretive work that cannot be done better by some other (set of) tool(s). 

A conjecture is a kind of conversational move. It is defined in terms of the role it plays in advancing the inquiry in which it occurs. While speech acts are finely individuated,[^SpeechActs] there is a small set of {% include concept.html word='contribution' %} types derivable from the goals of inqury.[^ConversationalForce] 

[^SpeechActs]: According to Searle's six-dimensional classification of speech acts... For Bach and Harnish...

[^ConversationalForce]: The notion in the text of *contribution type* is related to Paul Portner's *conversational force*, which he sees of as a notion, distinct from illocutionary force, that has implications for aspects of the grammatical system relating to syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

The primary goal of inquiry is to come to know something one did not know at its outset.[^Kitioi] Thus, an individual can advance us toward that goal by submitting (proposing) information to be taken on as mutually accepted. We call this kind of contribution an {% include concept.html word='assertion.' %}

[^Kitioi]: Knowledge as the goal of inquiry.

The end point of an inquiry depends in part on its starting point, which is the *issue* that is to be resolved by the process of inquiry. An individual can submit a new issue to the inquiry to be taken on as providing a new goal for the inquiry.  We call this contribution a {% include concept.html word='question' %}.[^command][^mood]

[^command]: Sometimes added to this list of contribution types is the *command*, which proposes a non-linguistic demand upon a participant in the inquiry. The appropriate response to such a contribution is to make the world such that the demand is met (or to reject the demand itself).

[^mood]: Each of these contribution types has an associated linguistic mood. Inquiry is a structured process, in which it is important not only what information is available but also how it is to be put to use in reaching the goal. As an implementation of inquiry, linguistic discourse has conventional means of representing how the information is being put to use by a contribution. But the scope of contribution types is not limited by the set of conventional moods. Nor do I think the concept of *linguistic mood* cuts along the same joints as that of *contribution type*. What is important for a contribution type is that there is a recognizably unique way in which information is put to use to further the goals of the inquiry.

These commonly cited examples do not provide an exhaustive list of conceptually possible contribution types, nor do propose that we can derive identity conditions specific to types of contribution from them. But the examples do share certain things in common, and their common traits can provide us with criteria for recognizing novel contribution types.

First, each type outlined above operates on {% include concept.html word='information' %} in a different way. The currency of inquiry is information, and its value is tied to the ways in which information can be put to use to advance the inquiry toward its goal. Second, each of these types *anticipates an appropriate response*, and *places constraints on the form of the response*. And last, each of the types above is carried by a conventionalized linguistic tool. If a contribution belongs to a specific type, language will have found a way to implement that type.

> **Criteria for genuine contribution types:**
> 
>  1. A genuine contribution type has a natural discourse pair complement.
>  2. A genuine contribution type implements a unique operation on information.
>  3. A genuine contribution type is realized by a conventionalized linguistic tool.

I wish to maintain that posits constitute a genuine contribution type distinct from the others listed. Posits are similar to assertions in that they seems to provide a proposal of added information, and they are similar to questions in that they seem to present an issue that is up for further discussion.[^supposition] But posits are distinct from each of these, and call for a unique treatment.  That they earn such status is what I hope to show throughout the course of this project.

[^supposition]: They are also similar to suppositions in that they seem to be less than fully committal on the part of the speaker. Assertion is generally associated with a commitment that it generates for the speaker.  This commitment involves some evidential relation between the asserter and the information conveyed, though it is controversial just what relation it is. But whatever the relation amounts to, it seems clear that we sometimes offer contributions to discourse that go beyond the evidence we have available. And we do this not just as a means of flouting the rules of discourse, but frequently in order to respect the project of the communicative exchange.]

### Levels of dynamism

It is folly, Frege warned, to ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, prescribing instead that the sentence as a whole be the proper unit of semantic investigation. The dynamic turn in semantics did Frege's *context principle* one better. On the basis of anomolous linguistic data involving anaphora resolution, attention was shifted from single sentences to the broader linguistic context in which their specific instantiations appear. Thus it has been suggested that the proper units of linguistic evaluation are extended texts or conversations, what I refer to here as *discourses*. 

The many varieties of dynamic semantic accounts share in common a model of discourses in which there is exists a theoretical platform upon which information is built in a stepwise manner over the course of the discourse. Each subsequent contribution to the discourse is analyzed in terms of what it constructs upon the platform or what previous construction it wipes away. The materials of which discourses are built include *possible worlds*, *situations*, *events*, *discourse referents*, and set-theoretic constructs thereof. This platform and its associated construction go variously by names such as *discourse representation*, *conversational scoreboard*, *common ground*, and *information state*. I couch my discussion within this broad tradition of theories and refer to the semantic representation variously as the *information state* or *state of information* of the discourse.

These semantic theories are dynamic in that they describe how new contributions to a discourse *respond to* and *modify* what has preceded, and discourse is very much dynamic in this sense. But by and large, they fail to capture another way in discourse is dynamic. Contributions to discourse also *anticipate* what is to follow in the discussion, and this feature of how discourses proceed ought to be brought under the umbrella of semantic theory.

### Collaboration and discourse pairs

Discourse is an essentially collaborative process.^[Here I turn my attention primarily to conversations held among multiple interlocutors in real time. Though I think many insights touched on in what follows apply also to individually composed texts, they admittedly demand extended discussion.] At a superficial level, successful discourse requires that the participants accurately understand each others' contributions.  This requires constant feedback, step retracing, and repair to keep everyone on the same page.  But the importance of collaboration goes deeper than this.  Herb Clark and his contributors [-@clark1992] have documented a variety of discourse maneuvers in which individuals other than the interlocutor who initiates the contribution provide input essential to its completion. This has led Clark to suggest that discourse contribututions involve two distinct phases: the *initiation* and the *completion*. Crucially (and in general), responsibility for the two phases of contribution is distributed among the conversational participants.

Clark is primarily concerned with the phonological and syntactic representation of discourse contribtutions, and with how the collaborative process determines the reference of individual words. But the same insights extend to the level of semantico-pragmatic representation as well. 

A principle way in which the collaborative nature of discourse is realized is in the way that assertion updates the state of information. Following Robert Stalnaker [-@stalnaker1978], I understand the principle effect of assertion to be the elimination of uncertainty, which is modeled as the elimination of previously open possibilities from the information state. But Stalnaker also recognizes that there are two stages to the impact of an assertion. The first is an automatic update that takes place implicitly. It involves incorporating information into the common ground that includes things such as the fact that the speaker is speaking, a record of the salient objects that have been introduced to the context, and perhaps other forms of not-at-issue content of the utterance. The second stage of assertion involves an expansion of the state of information to incorporate the at-issue content of the utterance. Unlike the at first stage, this expansion does not take place automatically. Instead, the speaker's fellow interlocutors are given the power to either accept or reject the proposal before the context set is updated.^[Even if rejected, the proposal is likely entered into the conversational record in some form for the purpose of anaphoric reference later on.] Thus, it is fitting to think of assertion as involving two distinct phases: an initiation, which involves the proposal of the asserted content by the speaker, and a completion, which involves either the acceptance or rejection of the asserted content by the hearer.

Collaboration is even more evident in the case of questions and answers. Questions can of course be accepted or rejected, but they also *call for* a particular form of response. That is, questions present an *issue*, which carries with it certain *felicity contitions* that acceptable responses must meet, and the question cannot be considered closed until a response meeting those conditions is proffered. 

An assertion combines with an acceptance or rejection and and a question combines with an answer to form what we can call a *discourse pair*. Each pair involves an ititiation (assertion or question) and a completion (acceptance/rejection or answer). The initiation phase presumes the possibility of a completion, and the completion depends upon the nature of the initiation. And, crucially, responsibility for the elements of the pair is distributed among the conversational participants.^[Interestingly, discourse initiations need not be immediately followed by their completions. A question may not be (fully) resolved until after a number of clarificatory amendments or sub-questions are introduced and resolved.]

Discourse pairs thus exhibit a recognizable pattern. A contribution is an initiation if it presumes, or *anticipates* a completion, which is accomplished by means of exerting felicity conditions on adequate responses.^[Compare to the notion of discourse coherence in, for example, Grosz et. al.]  A contribution is a completion if its content depends on, or *responds to* an initiation from prior discourse.

The deeply collaborative nature of discourse suggests another shift in semantic attention, expanding on the idea of discourse dynamics, and treating discourse pairs as the primary units of semantic evaluation. The novelty to this proposed shift is that semantic evaluation must trespass not only the boundaries between sentences but also the borders of turns taken in the conversational exchange.^[A key consequence of this insight is a solution to some worries regarding the semantic interpretation of speech acts and embedding data.]

I situate the formal implementation of my proposal within the class of theories known as *update semantics*. The key feature setting update semantics apart from classical, static semantics is that the semantic values of meaningful linguistic particles (or mental entities) are not worldly objects to which those particles *refer*. Instead, semantic values characterize the way in which a *state of information* is changed in response to a linguistic contribution.^[*Update* semantics further differ from merely *dynamic* semantics, in that states of information are built up with each new update as opposed to being erased and rewritten (cf. [@groenendijk1991, @dekker-pla]).]

I follow Sarah Murray [-@murray2014] in proposing that updates fall into one of three broad categories based on the nature of the change they bring to the state of information. *Direct updates* alter the makeup of the state of information, principally by eliminating elements thereof; *structural updates* alter the relations holding between elements of the state of information, perhaps by instituing an ordering among them; and *dref updates* introduce a new element to the state of information, the principle purpose of which is to make them available for anaphoroic reference.

Posits involve both direct and structural updates. Understanding why this is requires making sense of their role within the context of a conjecture/correction pair. It also requires addressing two key properties of of the use of posits in discourse.

1. Posits have *disputative potential*. The use of a conjecture calls out for correction if an interlocutor can provide it. Corrections can address a wide variety of features of an utterance, and an account of the semantic value of posits must make these features available for potential correction. I account for this feature by making use of the fact that within an update theoretic model, individual utterances (or even portions theoreof) can contribute a multitude of independent updates to the state of information. Corrections can address any of these many updates without impugning the others.^[Since, in an update theoretic model, a semantic value need not be linked to a distinct worldly entity, sentences (or thoughts) can be semantically complete and meaningful without the need to conjecture some thing that the sentence (thought) picks out. Instead, semantic values of complex meaningful particles can be treated as complexes of semantic values, each of which changes the state of information in its own way, and sequentially. ]

2. Posits are *resiliant*. The use of a conjecture need not be completely withdrawn in the face of disagreement. Posits update the common ground, but they don't seem to carry the level of commitment that is generally associated with assertions. This property is captured in part by the previously noted fact that even when corrected, utterances make multiple updates that pass unscathed. But this doesn't fully capture the power of making posits over assertions. To account for this, I introduce the notion of a *default saturation* of property level updates.^[Also important to capturing conjecture resiliance is the idea that discourse pairs constitute the basic unit of semantic evaluation.]

# Collaborative discourse dynamics in practice {#practice}

## Contrastive topic

Focus is a lingusitic tool whose use serves primarily to *package* information as opposed to providing its own contribution. It distinguishes the elements of a sentence that are new to the discussion from those that have already been introduced, thus showing to the other participants in the discourse how the contribution is intended to fit in with what has preceeded. In this sense, focus has a distinctly *backward looking* function. It depends on, and responds to, previous moves in the conversation. So it makes sense that the most common analyses of focus interpretation asign it a *presuppositional* semantic function. Focus adds a *felicity condition* to the overall import of a sentence; the sentence is interpretable in situ only if material matching the focus semantic value of the sentence can be found in the previously constructed conversation.

### Question/answer congruence ###

The star bit of data that is marshalled in support of this proposal is that of question/answer congruence. Questions are generally understood to have as their semantic value, the set of propositions that constitute answers to the question; alternatively, a set of resulutions of the issue raised by the question (@hamblin1958, @groenendijk1984). The most popular account of focus, due to Mats Rooth (-@rooth1992), assigns as the semantic value of focus, an alternative set generated by replacing the focused element of a sentence with elements from the domain (of the same type as the focused element and constrained by context). The account predicts that a focused sentence will count as a felicitous response to a question only when the focus is positioned in such a way that the generated alternative set matches the semantic value of the preceeding question.  And this is exactly what we find.[^qacong]

[^qacong]: Compare the responses to the following question:

    (A) Who ate the last cookie?
        (i) [Caitlin]<sub>f</sub> ate the last cookie.
        (ii) Caitlin ate the last [cookie]<sub>f</sub>

    While response (i) is a perfectly natural answer, the placement of focus in (ii) makes it stand out as unacceptable.  Following (@hamblin1958), a (suitably contextually constrained) semantic value for question A might be:

    (A') {_Albert ate the last cookie_, _Betsy ate the last cookie_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

    And, the proposed analysis of focus renders the following focus semantic values for the given responses:

    (i') {_Albert ate the last cookie_, _Betsy ate the last cookie_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

    (ii') {_Caitlin ate the last apple_, _Caitlin ate the last beet_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

    The alternative set generated by the focus in (i) is the same as the semantic value for question A, and that generated by the focus in (ii) is not.  Add in the proposed felicity condition, and you have a great explanation of question/answer congruence.

### The problem of contrastive focus ###

Analyzing focus interpretation in terms of a pragmatic rule connecting focus semantic values to semantic antecedents in prior discourse is incredibly fruitful. But now consider the following example:

(@picnic) - What did people bring to the picinic?
    - The [children]~cf~ brought [unbridled enthusiasm]~f~. 

This response involves two focused elements. For both elements, it is easy enough to generate the requisite alternative sets, and the alternative set generated for the second focused element (marked with a subscripted *f*), is perfectly congruent with the preceding question. But a difficulty arises when we attempt to apply the felicity condition to the element labeled with *cf* (for *contrastive focus*). Its alternative set is distinctly not congruent with the preceding question, so we would expect the entire utterance to be marked as infelicitous.

Daniel Buring (-@buering2003) has offered a technique to locate the requisite antecedent.  Building on the notion of the question under discussion developed by Cragie Roberts (-@roberts1998), Buring posits the existence of a *discourse tree*, which imbues the state of information with additional structure. Each question governing the inqury is a node in the tree and is associated with an array of subquestions, complete answers to which constitute partial answers to the parent question. The idea is that the subquestions provide a *plan of inquiry* for addressing the parent question. The objective of the inquiry is to answer the top-most question in the tree. The plan for doing so is to answer each of the subquestions in turn. Felicitous use of contrastive focus, it is suggested, generates an alternative set that is congruent to a subquestion present within the discourse tree.

To make sense of the current case, in which contrastive focus is present in the absence of an explicit (sub)question, we must appeal to the ever present *implicit* question under discussion. All discourses, it would be maintained, whether questions have been explicitly introduced or not, are governed by a plan of inquiry, which records necessary subquestions whether they are actually uttered or not. 

### Challenges to the QUD model ###

This proposal is a natural extension of the question under discussion (QUD) representation of information states. But it is not without downside.  First, it seems to strain the notion of presupposition pretty heavily. Not only is there no direct representation to stand as antecedent to the generated focus semantic value, contrastive topic is quite resiliant to infelicity.  In (@picnic), many different subsets of the class of picnic goes could have substituted felicitously for "children", and it's hard to see how the information state could plausibly have all of these options ready to hand. The common response to this sort of worry is to appeal to accommodation. If the state does not contain the d-tree needed to provide the antecedent for the contrastive focus, then straightaway it comes about. This reliance on accommodation is not without its own set of issues, predominantly stemming from the unconstrained character of accommodation as a theoretical conjecture.

But what I take to be the central issue with this sort of approach to the problem of contrastive topic is a conceptual one having to do with the role of corrections in discourse evolution. The question under discussion model of contrastive topic makes its discourse contribution entirely backward looking. Whatever role the focus plays is just a matter of checking prior discourse for an antecedent to the focus-generated alternative set. 

### Plans of inquiry ###

But now consider the following discourse:

(@bears) - Bears are dangerous.
	 - [Grizzly]~cf~ bears are dangerous.
	
This is an example of what I take to be a felicitous use of contrastive focus, in which there is no expicit question on the table at all. It seems to me that the role of the focus in (@bears) is more than simply to mark the way the response fits into previous discourse; it genuinely advances the inquiry along by correcting what predeeded. But to capture this added feature, we needn't dispose of Buring's useful plans of inquiry entirely. What we need is an expansion of the structure involved in such plans to include conjecture/correction congruence in addition to question/answer congruence. Focus, fundamentally, serves to indicate information structure, but information structure includes much more than just what is given and new. It also incorporates a record of where the inquiry has been as well as where it is going.

## Disagreement and the relativism v. contextualism debate ## {#relativism}

Disagreement has been a bit of a star figure in recent debates in the philosophy of language. Primarily, it has been used as a tool for assessing the adequacy of different proposals for the semantic contribution of certain expressions. Genuine disagreements, as opposed to spurious or merely apparent ones, intuitively require in the linguistic context or the minds of the disputants, the presence of some kind of content toward which the participants have incompatible commitments. 

The contestants in battle disagreement are *absolutism*, *contextualism*, and *relativism*, and the standard scorecard has absolutism and relativism coming out on top in virtue of their ability to secure the requisite constant content across uses of the expression. Contextualism, it is charged, assigns contents to the utterances and thoughts of different individuals that have them incurring different, compatible commitments as a result of their utterances or thoughts. 

Whatever stance we take on the outcome of this debate, disagreement does seem to be a valuable tool to have in the linguist's toolkit.  Language users have intuitions about the compatibility of sentences used in discourse, and linguistic theories ought to respect those intutions. But simply marking the presence of incompatible contents in a discourse is a relatively peripheral role for disagreement to play in lingusitic theorizing. As they stand, the semantic theories considered above give no insight into disputative discourse itself; they merely accord to a greater or lesser extent with one interesting consequence of such discourse. 

The previous discussion has shown that, in at least one way, disagreement plays a significant role in the very structure of communicative exchange; namely, in the conjecture/correction discourse pair. If the model provided is sound, it provides us with a different avenue for exploring the importance of disagreement as linguistic data. And, I believe, following the data where it leads provides us with a new motivation for incorporating relativism in semantic theory.
