Geurts on Corrections

# Introduction

Default reading, which is overwritten in a contrast laden variety.

Negation in its *metalinguistic use* for Horn is negation in its *denial making use* for Geurts (and van der Sandt).

Denials are marked, usually with a characteristic fall-rise intonation contour:

+ X isn't FALL; it's RISE

Geurts' taxonomy of denial, divisions based on independent mechanisms that perform the task associated with the use of negation.

+ Proposition denials
+ Presupposition denials
+ Implicature denials
+ Form denials

## Proposition denials

Similar to descriptive use of negation, but used to correct an earlier assertion in conversation.

But a denial may be given even in the absence of an explicitly given preceding assertion. The denial may target some perceived common knowledge that hasn't been explicitly presented.

+ This suggests that denial is a pragmatic category, relying heavily on conversational context.

May be either contrastive or non contrastive

## Presupposition denials

Used to correct a presupposition of an earlier presented assertion.

Both proposition denial and presupposition denial are frequently used to **reject** a prior utterance rather than simply **amend** (or correct it).

Typically noncontrastive

## Implicature denials

Used to correct an utterance by blocking a conversational implicature of a previous utterance.

Typically used **contrastively**, presenting both the element to be corrected and its replacement.

## Form denials

Covers a large number of examples in Horn's category of metalinguistic negation. Directed toward:

+ Form
+ Style
+ Register

Typically used contrastively

# Horn's metalinguistic account

Unitarian: account for all uses of denial under one mechanism

Swamping: applies to all the information conveyed by an utterance

Proposed test for metalinguistic negation:

+ failure of **incorporation of the negative particle** into the expression it applies to.
+ failure to license **negative polarity items**
+ associated with **contrastive contexts**
+ But all these tests have many counterexamples

Main issue is the swamping aspect of metalinguistic negation.

Since metalinguistic negation applies to *utterances* as opposed to propostions, its role is much like that of the **logician's turnstyle**, used to talk *about* logic from a metalinguistic standpoint.

+ Problematically, denials can occur in embedded contexts
  - In America, people don't eat to[mah]toes, but to[may]toes.
  - Barney claims that Mary didn't eat two but three bananas.
  - Mary is convinced that the king of France isn't bald because there is no king of France.
  - If Walter hadn't had three children but four...
+ It's problematic because Horn glosses Meta-N as an **operator** that applies to utterances.

# van der Sandt's no ambiguity account

Unitarian, Swamping

Proposal: denial negation applies to an **echo** of the original utterance, which carries all the information that that utterance carried.

+ Requires that we add as part of the information conveyed by an utterance *that* all words expressed in the utterance are pronounced as in the utterance
+ Thus, we propositionalize all form, style, and register elements of the utterance.

Again, swamping is problematic.

+ Denials can make use of anaphoric connections to previous utterances
+ But if the whole utterance is being denied, how does the referent survive to serve as antecedent to the pronoun?

Other worries:

+ Denials can have presuppositions, But how do echoes have presuppositions?
+ Denials can occur without explicit utterances, but what, then, are they echoing?

# Geurts' account

Non-unitarian, non-swamping

+ There are several types of denial, each of which it is implemented by a distinct mechanism.
+ The mechanisms are seldom directed at an entire utterance, instead affecting only some portion of the information carried by the utterance.
  - A consequence is that we need a way of bucketing information carried by an utterance.

+ Layered DRT would be useful for this, it seems. But Geurts hadn't yet developed it at the stage of this paper.

## Form denials

Semantic transfer: the contextual interpretation if an expression differs from its lexical/compositional meaning.

+ In form denials, a semantic transfer is invoked, so that the use of an expression picks out the appropriate element of its own form rather than its normal referent.
+ The mechanism for this may be very similar to that of quotation.
+ The fact that these denials are typically contrastive is expected, because the two shifted referents can be opposed to eachother non-contradictorily.

## Implicature denials

Scalars can be denied, and when they are they receive an **exactly** reading.

+ This could be due to semantic tranfer
+ Or maybe this reading is among the lexical meanings of such scalars.
+ A nice advantage here is that the account evokes contextual influence at a deep level, which allows it to capture difficult cases, such as:
  - Most photographers were *inarticulate* if not *subhuman*.
  - Here no real scale is evident.

## Presupposition denials

Presuppositions usually escape from the scope of operators, even negation. But in denials, negation can be used to cancel presuppositions.

Additionally, denials can give rise to their own presuppositions

Presupposition is not all about entailment; it's about finding an appropriate antecedent in the prior discourse (or common ground), whether that entity is propositional or not.

+ Call this the **binding** account of presupposition.
+ When a hearer interprets an utterance with a presupposition-inducing element, she attempts to bind it to a suitable antecedent.

Presuppositions that can't be bound, must be accommodated, but they can be accommodated at different sites

+ Thus, we have a version of ambiguity
+ There is a preference for global accommodation (highest DRS)
+ But if there is a conflict with other information in the global DRS, then the presupposiition has to be accommodated locally
+ Appropriate presuppositions thus get blocked from escaping the negation.


## Reparative denials

+ Julius didn't lose a finger but an entire hand.

These are similar to my examples, and Geurts takes them to be a variety of presupposition denial

He takes the focus structure to divide the information and invoke a presupposition that the ground is satisfied by something.

Thus, he takes his account to make sense of the presuppositional effects of focusing generally.


## Some thoughts on Geurts' proposal

+ Geurts thinks that proposition denial is not problematic, but I think that the corrections in my bears example denials an element of propositional content.
  - There is an associated presupposition, to be sure, so important to distinguish what is being denied and how the mechanism operates.

+ Layered DRT is foreshadowed in the explanation of presupposition denial.
  - I agree that there are different kinds of things moving around in contexts, but we want to keep the logical apparatus minimal and give it multiple jobs, is possible.
