+ A language fragment is static if its conversation system can be specified with exclusively *proposition adding* context change potentials.

conversational state
  : also *common ground*, *informational context*
  : the body of information mutually taken for granted by the discourse participants in context. Reflects the state of the conversation.
  : Modeled as a set of propositions

propostion adding
  : Successful assertion of the sentence involves adding a proposition to the commong round.

conversation system
  : A triple <L,C,[]>, where L is a set of sentences, C is a set of conversational states, and [] is an update function from L to a set of context change potentials on C.

context change potential
  : An operation on informational contexts reflecting the sentence's conventionally understood characteristic way of changing the state of a conversation.

state system
  : A pair of a set *C* of conversational states and a set *O* of unary operations (ccp's) *o* on *C*

static
  : A conversation system with a state system that is isomorphic to some intersective state system.

+ the level of conversation systems, does not deal with subsentential structure at all.
+ the level of compositional semantics, does not address context change potentials.

So, non-staticness may come in with the presence of different operations within the conversation system. 

But we may have a second-level conversation system dynamism if structure becomes essential in understanding the naure of such systems. For instance, if we need genuine relations-in-intension for modeling certain speech acts.
