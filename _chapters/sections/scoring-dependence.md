For, fans the most important values regarding player contributions are what leads to axcitement during game play and and what leads to a lasting feeling of satisfaction after game play has ceased. A team win is probably the simplest and greatest contributor to lasting satisfaction for the fan. But there is no guarantee that what contributes to excitement value during game play will corelate strongly with team wins.

Steals in baseball provide an excellent case in point. According to my own interest set, a suicide squeeze and an attempted steal of home are two immensely exciting plays in baseball game play, but most sabermatricians will tell you that they are rarely, if ever, advisable from a win percentage boosting perspective.

We can find an analogue of this divergence in value metrics within conversational tactics.  There are many ways to try to get a point across in conversation, some of which have a greater chance of success than others. Relying on the semantic content of an utterance may be more boring than invoking metaphor, irnoy, and various maxim flouting, but it more rarely leads to miscommunication.

## Value failings of traditional metrics ##

+ Metric is not highly corelated with wins
    - Steals
+ Metric does not represent the value of the individual to which it is attributed
    - ERA, RBI, QB Passing yards

## Examples of value dependence ##

Obviously, whether a pitch becomes a strike or not depends on the behavior of the batter. He must either not swing on a well-located pitch, or swing and miss on it for the result to be a strike. This sort of dependence is parallel to the recognition conditions associated with speech acts in communication. Whether my utterance counts as an assertion in a particular conversation depends on whether the hearer recognizes and ackowledges my offering.

But there is a crucial difference between strikes and, for instance, errors. Whether an offering of a struck ball by a batter counts as a hit, as opposed to an error or an out, will depend on the relevant fielder's positioning prior to the offering as well as their decisionmaking and situational skill in response to the offering.

The first type of dependence matters for whether an offering is entered into the conversational record (record of game play), but the second type of dependence determines how it is so entered.

An interesting question for the sports recorder is to decide whether an individual's teammates and opponents should be considered as just so many moving parts whose behavior is partially determinant of the nature of his offerings, or whether there is good reason to distinguish between teammates and opponents.

## Comparison to semantic theory ##

+ Eliminated entangled metrics from value calculation
    - FIP, true outcomes
    - Minimal semantics
+ Treat standard metrics as value accurate
    - ERA, RBI, assists
    - Dynamic semantics
+ Incorporate win shares into value metric
    - UZR, Pecota
    - Collaborative semantics

Whether an offering is evaluated as an assertion, as opposed to a conjecture or a question, will depend on the interlocutors' presupposition prior to the offering, their interpretation of the offering and their willignness to participate in the conversational exchange. Thus, the hearer plays a crucial role in determining both the truth value of an utterance as well as the type and level of commitment the speaker incurs as a result of it.

## On advanced metrics ##

One of the primary insights that the advanced metrics movement has brought to the experience of sports has been a recognition that not all ways of categorizing and recording events on the field of play equally well represents the value that individual players in the game contribute. 

Sports recording is a distinctly value relative endeavor.
