**Relational algebra**

+ Drefs as header, cg forms set of tuples (represents collaboration and links between drefs)
+ The reason for relativizing predicate to the relation set is...

A relation is a set of tuples. A header specifies the identity of the *attributes*, and the body consists of the set of possible groupings of values for the attributes. We alternately refer to a relation as a **table**. 

+ Projection (&pi;)

> Make an optionally resricted relation accessible for operation.

+ Selection (&sigma;)

> Return a portion of a relation, column restricted by attribute identity and row restricted by constraint on values.

+ Cartesian product (x)
