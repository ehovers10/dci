title: Dispute in discourse
level: 4

toc: yes
abstract:
  Disputing an utterance can be an important tool in collaborative inquiry. In this paper, I examine a simple dialogue involving dispute and consider two established proposals for analyzing the semantic and pragmatic import of the utterances it contains. I maintain that each is lacking in a well-defined regard and that collaborative update semantics, supplemented with a semantics for bare plurals, offers an alternative that better accounts for the natural interpretation of the dialogue.

# Disputative discourse

Disputes can be frivolous, fractured, and fraudulent. They can derail conversations, and generate so much animosity that perpetuating the dispute itself comes to mean more than the prospect of resolving it.  These disputes may have very little to do with actual conflict over the informational potential of the disputative language used to express them, instead being driven by *ad hominem* and *ad ideologiam* tendencies.

But dispute can also be a fruitful tool for people involved in an honest, cooperative attempt to further mutual knowledge. For one thing, interlocutors sometimes lose track of the cooperative effort, and it is valuable to have a means of correcting them to bring them back on to the task at hand.  But dispute can also play a more central role in the project of inquiry. Corrections, I have claimed, are a crucial tool in properly vetting conjectures in discourse. As such, some element of dispute is central to the enterprise of inquiry. 

I contend that the conjecture/correction discourse pair provides a genuine contribution to inquiry. In the previous chapter, I motivated this status by providing a model of discourse dynamics that carves out a distinctive operation on information that this contribution makes. In this chapter I explore another criterion for genuine a contribution: that it be represented in some conventionalized linguistic tool. I think that this tool is {% include concept.html word="focus," %} and that the virtues of collaborative discourse dynamics come to prominence in explaining focus interpretation when we examine {% include concept.html word="contrastive topic" %} specifically.

The following little discourse, which I label *Bears*, will be the stalking horse for the discussion to follow.

<!-- Grizzly bears -->
{% capture bears %}
{% include ex.html type="ex" sent="Bears are dangerous." sub="[Grizzly]<sub>cf</sub> bears are dangerous." term="bears" %}
{% endcapture %}

{{ bears }}

The bracketed material represents {% include concept.html word="focus." base="" %} *Grizzly* in the (b) sentence is marked with a *cf* for {% include concept.html word="contrastive focus." base="contrast" e="" %} We will have more to say about the importance of focus in this dialogue later on. For now, there are a number of interesting pretheoretical observations to be made about the [Bears] dialogue. 

First, the (b) utterance is not merely a dismissal of (a). Instead, it is a natural follow up to, which is to say that (b) {% include concept.html word="coheres" base="coherence" e="" %} with (a). An ability to resolve a coherence relation among a group of utterances in a discourse is a crucial element of interpreting the discourse in context. A particularly salient coherence relation may force an interpretation to light. For instance, consider the following example due to Andrew Kehler {% include ref.html id="kehler2000" o="" p="539" e=":" %}
  
<!-- Presidents -->
{% include ex.html type="ex" term="presidents" sent="<em>?&nbsp;</em>Bill likes to play golf. George hates broccoli." %}

The [Presidents](#presidents) dialogue is marked to indicate that it can seem somewhat stilted, resembling two independent sentences rather than a coherent story line. However, if we point out that the subjects in the two sentences can refer to past presidents and interpret the predicates as picking out the subjects' respective publicized traits, we impose a *parallel* relation on the two sentences and uptake goes through much more smoothly.

Kehler suggests that coherence relations imbue a discourse with an additional meaning that goes beyond the sum of its individual parts. He also maintains that linguistic coherence is subject to a Neo-Humean classification based on the basic forms of connection between idea. All connections among ideas, David Hume suggests {% include ref.html id="hume1777" o="" %}, can be reduced to one of three principal such connections: *Resemblance*, *Contiguity* in spacetime, and *Cause/Effect*. Hume's reductive base is perhaps a bit too narrow. If we construre *resemblance* broadly enough, we can bring a wide swath of connections under its umbrella, but it seems to me that there are basic relations among ideas that Hume's reduction leaves out -- in particular, the set of relations corresponding to the *relative generality* of two ideas pertaining to the same domain.[^mereology] The [Bears](#bears) completion is the flip-side of resemblance relations in that it highlights a *distinction* within a class that was previously over-looked. In moving from a coarser to a more granular conception of the sub-space of reality corresponding to beardom, the [Bears](#bears) dialogue exhibits a relation of {% include concept.html word="refinement" base="" e="" %} between the ideas expressed in its utterances.

[^mereology]: A philosophical celebrity within the family of relative generality relations is that of *part* to *whole*. That such a relation is a basic logical connection between ideas is emphasized by Goodman and Leonard in their classic explication of the calculus of individuals:
  
    > "The relations of segments of the universe are treated in traditional logistic at two place, first in its theorems concerning the identity and diversity of individuals, and second in its calculus of membership and class-inclusion. But further relations of segments and of classes frequently demand consideration. For example, what is the relation of the class of windows to the class of buildings? No member of either class is a member of the other, nor are any of the segments isolated by the one concept identical with segments isolated by the other. Yet the classes themselves have a very definite relation in that each window is a part of some building. We cannot express this fact in the language of a logistic which lacks a part-whole relation between individuals unless, by making use of some special physical theory, we raise the logical type of each window and each building to the level of a class -- say a class of atoms -- such that any class of atoms that is a window will be included (class-inclusion) in some class that is a building. Such an unforutnate dependence of logical formulation upon the discovery and adoption of a special physical theory, or even upon the presumption that such a suitable theory could in every case be discovered in the course of time, indicates serious deficienceis in the ordinary logistic. Furthermore, a raising of type like that illustrated above is often precluded in a constructional system by other considerations govering the choice of pimitive ideas." {% include ref.html id="goodman1940" o="n" p="45" e="" %}

<!-- Refinement -->
{% capture coherenceobs %}
The [Bears](#bears) dialogue is *coherent*, exhibiting a relation of *refinement* between the first and second utternace.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture coherenceexplic %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include ex.html type="obs" term="refinement" defn=coherenceobs explic=coherenceexplic %}

To emphasize the coherent nature of the dialogue, I call the first utterance the {% include concept.html word="initiation" base="" e="" %} and the second utterance the {% include concept.html word="completion." base="" %}

The function of coherence relations is to improve interprebility of the discourse by imposing a restriction on the space of possible conceptions of what the initial speaker is getting at, thereby making the selection procedure for how to respond operate more smoothly. And refinement genuinely does help thin the space of possibilities, as we can see from the following alternative continuation of the [Bears](#bears) initiation:
  
{% include ex.html type="ex" term="Druggy bears" sent="Bears are dangerous." sub="<em>?&nbsp;</em>Bears [in a drug-induced stupor]<sub>cf</sub> are dangerous." %}

While perhaps no less true than the original correction, I've marked the completion in [Druggy bears](#druggy-bears) to indicate the increased processing load it carries.[^processingload] This, I suggest, is because the completion expresses a less natural refinement of the discourse domain. As a result, the discourse coherence is reduced.

[^processingload]: The claim that the [Druggy bears](#bears) completion does indeed carry a larger processing load is based upon my own interpretation of the discourse.

There is a distinctive, disputative tone in the [Bears](#bears) completion, but it differs from that in, for instance:
  
{% include ex.html type="ex" term="boars" sent="Bears are dangerous." sub="You mean <em>boars</em> are dangerous." %}

In [Boars](#boars), the second utterance breaks the flow of inquiry to attempt to fix a perceived error in the preceding discourse. In this example, the disputative *You mean...* is used to signal an attempted {% include concept.html word="repair strategy." base="" %} 

The observation that the [Bears](#bears) dialogue exhibits coherent discourse suggests that the disputative tone of its completion ought not to be treated as signaling a break in the inquiry. Imposing the refinement relation on the discourse eliminates any sense of fault on the part of the initiation in allowing for proper uptake. Instead, we interpret the completion utterance as a {% include concept.html word="correction," base="" e="" %} which is characterized by a dual function of providing: (i) a *denial* of some element of the preceding attempted contribution to discourse and (ii) a *positive contribution* that is related in a salient way to the preceding attempted contribution. 

<!-- Correction -->
{% capture correctionobs %}
The completion phase of the [Bears](#bears) discourse serves to {% include concept.html word="correct" base="correction" e="" %} the initiation phase, a *correctible* utterance.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture correctionexplic %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include ex.html type="obs" term="correction" defn=correctionobs explic=correctionexplic %}

As elements of coherent dialogue involving correction, I refer to sentences such as the initiation in [Bears](#bears) as {% include concept.html word="correctibles." base="correctible" %}

While the completion in the [Bears](#bears) dialogue is a natural one, it certainly isn't the only {% include concept.html word="felicitous" base="felicity" e="" %} response to the initiation. It is open to the responder to challenge the initiation in another way, but interestingly, it is also open to the initiator to retrench in certain ways, as in the following alternate extension of the *Bears* initiation:
  
{% include ex.html type="ex" sent="Bears are dangerous." sub="What about Teddy bears?,I didn't mean <em>all</em> bears." term="teddy bears"%}

The retrenchment in (c) strikes my ear as an acceptable response to the challenge in (b). It is similar to the data that Thony Gillies and Kai von Fintel {% include ref.html id="vonfintel2008" o="" %} analyze in regard to retraction of *might* claims. Consider the following, drawn from {% include ref.html id="vonfintel2008" o="n" p="81" e=":" %}

{% include ex.html type="ex" term="keys" sent="Alex: The keys might be in the drawer." sub="Billy (<em>Looks in the drawer.</em>) They're not. Why did you say that?,Alex: I didn't say they <em>were</em> in the drawer. I said they <em>might be</em> there -- and they might have been. Sheesh." defn="Obs/Def" %}

*Might* claims are sometimes retracted when presented with countervailing evidence available in a different context from the original utterance. But as [Keys](#keys) makes clear, *might* claims are ocassionally *resiliant* in the face of such challenges. The felicity of the exchange in [Teddy bears](#teddy-bears) suggests that correctible initiations exhibit similar resilliance.

{% capture resilianceobs %}
The [Bears](#bears) initiation is *resiliant*. The dialogue extension provided below is felicitous in the proper context.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture resilianceexplic %}
The [Teddy bears](#teddy-bears) dialogue presents an alternative coherent continuation of the initiation in [Bears](#bears). 
{% endcapture %}
{% include ex.html type="obs" term="resiliance" defn=resilianceobs explic=resilianceexplic %}

A corrolary to the resiliance of correctible initiations is that completions that involve correction add to the discourse in a specific way. They don't just link back to previous discourse, but change in. That is, corrections are *productive*.

{% capture productivityobs %}
The [Bears](#bears) completion is *productive*. It does not merely refer back to the initiation but extends the discourse in a distinctive way.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture productivityexplic %}
+ Focusing in the completion is performing a forward-looking role as well as a backward-looking one.
{% endcapture %}
{% include ex.html type="obs" term="productivity" defn=productivityobs explic=productivityexplic %}

I take it that an adequate account of the discourse dynamics of the [Bears](#bears) dialogue ought to respect these observations. In the remainder of this paper, I examine two extant proposals in the literature and contend that neither captures these observations in their entirety. My preferred analysis is based upon the collaborative update framework, supplementing it with an analysis of {% include concept.html word="bare plurals." base="" e="" %}

# Correction as contrastive topic

A salient feature of the [Bears](#bears) dialogue is the presence of {% include concept.html word="focus" %} on *grizzly* in the response utterance. Focus is a lingusitic tool whose use serves primarily to *package* information as opposed to providing its own contribution. It distinguishes the elements of a sentence that are new to the discussion from those that have already been introduced, thus showing to the other participants in the discourse how the contribution is intended to fit with what has preceeded. In this sense, focus has a distinctly *backward looking* function. It depends on, and responds to, previous moves in the conversation. So it makes sense that the most common analyses of focus interpretation assign it a *presuppositional* pragmatic function. Focus adds a *felicity condition* to the overall import of a sentence; the sentence is interpretable in situ only if material matching the focus semantic value of the sentence can be found in the previously constructed conversation.

Well established theories of focus interpretation exist. If these could be marshalled to explain the distinctive discourse-dynamical features of [Bears](#bears), we would not have to resort to positing drastic discourse-structural modification. In this section, I explore an alternative semantics account of focus interpretation in terms of its ability to capture the observations noted above.

## Focus and alternatives

## Questions under discussion

The star bit of data that is marshalled in support of this proposal is that of question/answer congruence. Questions are generally understood to have as their semantic value, the set of propositions that constitute answers to the question; alternatively, a set of resulutions of the issue raised by the question {% include ref.html id="hamblin1958,groenendijk1984" o="n" e="," %}. The most popular account of focus, due to Mats Rooth {% include ref.html id="rooth1992" o="" e="," %} assigns as the semantic value of focus, an alternative set generated by replacing the focused element of a sentence with elements from the domain (of the same type as the focused element and constrained by context). The account predicts that a focused sentence will count as a felicitous response to a question only when the focus is positioned in such a way that the generated alternative set matches the semantic value of the preceeding question. And the prediction bears out.

The star bit of data that is marshalled in support of this proposal is that of question/answer congruence. Compare the responses to the following question:

{% include ex.html type="ex" sent='Who ate the last cookie?' sub='[Caitlin]<sub>f</sub> ate the last cookie,Caitlin ate the last [cookie]<sub>f</sub>' term="cookie" %} 

While response (i) is a perfectly natural answer, the placement of focus in (ii) makes it stand out as unacceptable.  Following {% include ref.html id="hamblin1958" o="n" e="," %} a (suitably contextually constrained) semantic value for question A might be:

(A') {_Albert ate the last cookie_, _Betsy ate the last cookie_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

And, the proposed analysis of focus renders the following focus semantic values for the given responses:

a. {_Albert ate the last cookie_, _Betsy ate the last cookie_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

b. {_Caitlin ate the last apple_, _Caitlin ate the last beet_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

The alternative set generated by the focus in (i) is the same as the semantic value for question A, and that generated by the focus in (ii) is not.  Add in the proposed felicity condition, and you have a great explanation of question/answer congruence.

## Plans of inquiry

Analyzing focus interpretation in terms of a pragmatic rule connecting focus semantic values to semantic antecedents in prior discourse is incredibly fruitful. But now consider the following example:

{% include ex.html type="ex" sent='What did people bring to the picinic?' sub='The [children]<sub>cf</sub> brought [unbridled enthusiasm]<sub>f</sub>' term="picnic" %}

This response involves two focused elements. For both elements, it is easy enough to generate the requisite alternative sets, and alternative set generated for the second focused element (marked with a subscripted *f*), is perfectly congruent with the preceding question. But a difficulty arises when we attempt to apply the felicity condition to the element labeled with *cf* (for *contrastive focus*). Its alternative set is distinctly not congruent with the preceding question, so we would expect the entire utterance to be marked as infelicitous.

Daniel Buring [buering2003] has supplied us with a technique to locate the requisite antecedent.  Building on the notion of the question under discussion developed by Cragie Roberts [roberts1998], Buring posits the existence of a *discourse tree*, which provides structure for the inquiry being undertaken. Each question governing the inqury is a node in the tree and is associated with an array of subquestions, complete answers to which constitute partial answers to the parent question.  The idea is that the subquestions provide a _plan of inquiry_ for addressing the parent question. The objective of the inquiry is to answer the top-most question in the tree. The plan for doing so is to answer each of the subquestions in turn.

But how should we apply this porposal to the current case, where contrastive focus is present without any explicit question? We can, of course, appeal again to the ever present implicit question under discussion. All discourses, it would be maintained, whether questions have been explicitly introduced or not, are governed by a plan of inquiry, which is structured by questions, implicit if need be. Then, the explanation of the contrastive topic in (@bears) would be that the original assertion offers an answer to a parent question, and the correction that follows rejects this answer, replacing it with an answer to a subquestion.

This proposal certainly fits with the structure of the question under discussion representation of the conversational scoreboard. But we may be left a little unsatisfied with the details.  First, it seems to be straining the notion of presupposition pretty heavily. Not only is there no direct representation to stand as antecedent to the generated focus semantic value, [AS WAS POINTED OUT EARLIER] contrastive topic is quite resiliant to infellicity.  Many different potential elements could have been fellicitously focused, and it's hard to see how the conversational scoreboard could have all of these options ready to hand. The common response to this sort of worry is to appeal to accommodation. If the scoreboard does not contain the d-tree needed to provide the antecedent for the contrastive focus, then straightaway it comes about. This reliance on accommodation is not without its own set of issues, predominantly stemming from the unconstrained character of accommodation as a theoretical posit.

But what I take to be the central issue with this sort of approach to the problem of contrastive topic in corrections is a conceptual one having to do with the role of corrections in discourse evolution. The question under discussion model of contrastive topic makes the discourse contribution of contrastive topic entirely backward looking. Whatever role the focus plays is just a matter of checking prior discourse for an antecedent to the focus generated alternative set. 

## Limitations to corrections as contrastive topic

# Denial as downdate

Equally salient in the [Bears](#bears) dialogue is the disputative nature of the response statement. It seems to simultaneously *deny* the original statement and *substitute* an alternative to it. Let's call utterances with this dual function *corrections*. Jennifer Spenader and Emar Maier {% include ref.html id="spenader2009" %}, expanding on work of Maier and Bart Geurts {% include ref.html id="geurts1998a,geurtsa" %}, attempt to treat corrections as *downdating* the information state. On this proposal, the function of corrections is to remove from the discourse representation something that was previous added to it. A wrinkle is that corrections do not eliminate information wholesale. Consider, fo example:

{% include ex.html type="ex" sent="The movie was funny." sub="The movie wasn't [funny]<sub>f</sub>, it was [hilarious]<sub>f</sub>." %}

In this section, I examine the downdate account of denial in terms of its ability to capture the observations about [Bears](#bears) noted earlier.

## Correction as information state revision

The issue raised for the correction-as-revision approach is familiar from the literature on belief revision stemming from the work of Gardenfors (in AGM) -- namely, that there are multiple ways to coherently downdate an information state.

The standard solution in belief revision is to supplement the belief state with an *entrenchment relation*, which serves to rank elements of the state (either sentences for the syntactic model or worlds in the semantic model) in terms of their susceptibility to downdate. This puts constraints on how belief state is revised in response to its falling into incoherence. But crucially, the entrenchment relation does not fix a unique revision strategy.

Similarly, the LDRT approach to correction places constraints on downdate by linking drefs via the conditions they bind. But the constraints need not fix a unique downdate strategy. They do so only incidentally in the case of entity type drefs.

It may be suggested that this is a feature rather than a bug in the LDRT proposal, as it allows for a more open-ended and interactive approach to correction. Different conversational participants' scoreboards can diverge based on their different, equally rational, downdate strategies. And this fact helps explain how corrective discourses occasionally degrade into confusion.

I can allow that such a response could be worked out and that it would have certain merits. But it is not an approach I favor, because I am additionally swayed by conceptual motivations for working out a more natural integration of the components of corrective discourse.

I think that the issue reveals the patchy nature of the dref binding fix. Corrective discourse is central enough to inquiry that it calls for an integrated implementation.

## Application of revision theory to correction

Revision of an information state takes place when a state degrades into incoherence. The primary source of incoherence is an attempt to update with a proposition whose negation is entailed by the state. Revisions can be analyzed into two components: a downdate, in which the problem proposition as well as a subset of its entailments is removed from the information state; and an update, in which the negation of the proposition is added to the state and the state is appropraitely closed.

**First amendment:** The revision procedure must be amended because corrections do not in general force elimination of utterances whole-sail. Instead, utterances are multi-facted, and corrections tend to mar only a single face, allowing others through unchanged.

To account for this, we add information to our state representations not as information full-stop, but indexed with an information type, where information types indicate the manner in which the information is added to the state. We can think of the information state as being divided into layers based on this indexing. Certain information may be present on multiple layers.

But information state coherence is insensiive to indexing. If a proposition is present on one layer while its negation is present only on a distinct layer, the information state is still incoherent. The layers then provide us with an added means of constraining appropriate revision in the face of incoherence. Certain layers can be assumed to trump others, so that the information on one layer is always more entrenched than information on another.

**Second amendment:** But once information is partitioned in this way, the system is exposed to binding concerns. The binding problem, as it has come to be known, was introduced in a famous footnote to Karttunen and Peters' *Conventional Implicature*. In the system expounded in that paper, conventional implicature is set apart as a distinct dimension of content from the standard semantic content derived from the meaning of the words in a sentence and the way they are put together. Cleaving implicature from semantic content allows us to explain a number of interesting features about how conventional implicatures work, but it also makes it more difficult to explain the ways in which elements of semantic content can interact with elements of the implicature. And it is finding such inroads between severed contents that is termed the binding problem.

Because the amended revision approach involves dividing content by way of indexing, we may be concerned that a binding problem will arise here as well. But the system has a built in fix that it acquires from the structure of DRSs. A discourse representation structure is formally a pair of sets. One set is the universe of the DRS; it contains all the abstract discourse referents (of whatever type) that are introduced in the conversation being represented by the DRS. The other is a set of conditions, which place constraints on elements of the universe in the form of properties and relations holding of and among them. In LDRT, while the conditions are indexed by their layer, the drefs are not. Thus, a single dref can be shared by conditions of different layers. 

# Collaboration, plurals, and precision

The general collaborative update framework forms the backbone of the analysis of [Bears](#bears) via the addition of sandboxes and evolving content (modifiable saturation). But the nature of the saturation is determined by the semantic structure of the particular utterance involved.

Bare plurals are treated as generalized quantifiers with universal force subject to variable refinement. Bare plurals are, in this sense, variably strict.
