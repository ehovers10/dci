abstract:
  Disputing an utterance can be an important tool in collaborative inquiry. In this paper, I examine a simple dialogue involving dispute and consider two established proposals for analyzing the semantic and pragmatic import of the utterances it contains. I maintain that each is lacking in a well-defined regard and that collaborative update semantics, supplemented with a semantics for bare plurals, offers an alternative that better accounts for the natural interpretation of the dialogue.

# Disputative discourse

Disputes can be frivolous, fractured, and fraudulent. They can derail conversations, and generate so much animosity that perpetuating the dispute itself comes to mean more than the prospect of resolving it.  These disputes may have very little to do with actual conflict over the informational potential of the disputative language used to express them, instead being driven by *ad hominem* and *ad ideologiam* tendencies.

But dispute can also be a fruitful tool for people involved in an honest, cooperative attempt to further mutual knowledge. For one thing, interlocutors sometimes lose track of the cooperative effort, and it is valuable to have a means of correcting them to bring them back on to the task at hand.  But dispute can also play a more central role in the project of inquiry. Corrections, I have claimed, are a crucial tool in properly vetting conjectures in discourse. As such, some element of dispute is central to the enterprise of inquiry. 

I contend that the conjecture/correction discourse pair provides a genuine contribution to inquiry. In the previous chapter, I motivated this status by providing a model of discourse dynamics that carves out a distinctive operation on information that this contribution makes. In this chapter I explore another criterion for genuine a contribution: that it be represented in some conventionalized linguistic tool. I think that this tool is {% include concept.html word="focus," %} and that the virtues of collaborative discourse dynamics come to prominence in explaining focus interpretation when we examine {% include concept.html word="contrastive topic" %} specifically.

The following little discourse, which I label *Bears*, will be the stalking horse for the discussion to follow.

{% capture bears %}
{% include ex1.html sent="Bears are dangerous." sub="[Grizzly]<sub>cf</sub> bears are dangerous." term="bears" %}
{% endcapture %}

{{ bears }}

The bracketed material represents {% include concept.html word="focus." base="" %} *Grizzly* in the (b) sentence is marked with a *cf* for {% include concept.html word="contrastive focus." base="contrast" e="" %} We will have more to say about the importance of focus in this dialogue later on. For now, there are a number of interesting pretheoretical observations to be made about the [Bears] dialogue. 

First, the (b) utterance is not merely a dismissal of (a). Instead, it is a natural follow up to, which is to say that (b) {% include concept.html word="coheres" base="coherence" e="" %} with (a). An ability to resolve a coherence relation among a group of utterances in a discourse is a crucial element of interpreting the discourse in context. A particularly salient coherence relation may force an interpretation to light. For instance, consider the following example due to Andrew Kehler {% include ref.html id="kehler2000" o="" p="539" e=":" %}
  
{% include ex.html term="presidents" sent="<em>?</em>Bill likes to play golf. George hates broccoli." %}

The [Presidents](#presidents) dialogue is marked to indecate that it can seem somewhat stilted, resembling two independent sentences rather than a coherent story line. However, if we point out that the subjects in the two sentences can refer to past presidents and interpret the predicates as picking out the subjects' respective publicized traits, we impose a *parallel* relation on the two sentences and uptake goes through much more smoothly.

Kehler suggests that coherence relations imbue a discourse with an additional meaning that goes beyond the sum of its individual parts. He also maintains that linguistic coherence is subject to a Neo-Humean classification based on the basic forms of connection between idea. All connections among ideas, David Hume suggests {% include ref.html id="hume1777" o="" %}, can be reduced to one of three principal such connections: *Resemblance*, *Contiguity* in spacetime, and *Cause/Effect*. 
  
{% capture coherenceobs %}
The [Bears](#bears) dialogue is *coherent*. The second utterance is directly relevant to the first utterance.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture coherenceexplic %}
+ This means that the focus present in the second utterance ought not to be treated as signaling a {% include concept.html word="repair strategy" base="" e="." %} The relevance of the second utterance suggests that there is no fault in the first utterance that must be repaired.
+ To emphasize the coherent nature of the dialogue, I call the first utterance the {% include concept.html word="initiation" base="" e="" %} and the second utterance the {% include concept.html word="completion" base="" e="." %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include obs.html term="coherence" defn=coherenceobs explic=coherenceexplic %}

The particular flavor of coherence {% include ref.html id="kehler2000" o="n" %} involved in the discourse is that of correction, which is characterized by a dual function for the completion utterance: (i) a *denial* of some element of the preceding attempted contribution to discourse and (ii) a *positive contribution* that is related in a salient way to the preceding attempted contribution. As elements of a coherent dialogue involving correction, I refer to sentences such as the initiation in [Bears](#bears) as {% include concept.html word="correctibles." base="correctible" %}

{% capture correctionobs %}
The second utterance in the [Bears](#bears) discourse serves to {% include concept.html word="correct" base="correction" e="" %} the first utterance.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture correctionexplic %}
Corrections involve two elements:
  
+ A *denial* of some element of the preceding attempted contribution to discourse.
+ A *positive contribution* that is related in a salient way to the preceding attempted contribution.
{% endcapture %}
{% include obs.html term="correction" defn=correctionobs explic=correctionexplic %}

While the completion utterance in the [Bears](#bears) dialogue is a natural one, it certainly isn't the only {% include concept.html word="felicitous" base="felicity" e="" %} response to the initiation. It is open to the responder to challenge the initiation in another way, but interestingly, it is also open to the initiator to retrench in certain ways, as in the following alternate extension of the *Bears* initiation:
  
{% include ex1.html sent="Bears are dangerous." sub="What about Teddy bears?,I didn't mean *all* bears." term="teddy bears"%}

The retrenchment in (c) strikes my ear as an acceptable response to the challenge in (b). In so far as this is true, it suggests that correctible initiations possess an interesting level of *resiliance*.[^cialeaks]

[^cialeaks]: Compare the variable degree of retrenchment available for utterers of supposedly relative expressions outlined in {% include ref.html id="vonfintel2008" o="n" e="." %}

{% capture resilianceobs %}
The [Bears](#bears) initiation is *resiliant*. The dialogue extension provided below is felicitous in the proper context.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture resilianceexplic %}
The [Teddy bears](#teddy-bears) dialogue presents an alternative coherent continuation of the initiation in [Bears](#bears). 
{% endcapture %}
{% include obs.html term="resiliance" defn=resilianceobs explic=resilianceexplic %}

A corrolary to the resiliance of correctible initiations is that completions that involve correction add to the discourse in a specific way. They don't just link back to previous discourse, but change in. That is, corrections are *productive*.

{% capture productivityobs %}
The [Bears](#bears) completion is *productive*. It does not merely refer back to the initiation but extends the discourse in a distinctive way.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture productivityexplic %}
+ Focusing in the completion is performing a forward-looking role as well as a backward-looking one.
{% endcapture %}
{% include obs.html term="productivity" defn=productivityobs explic=productivityexplic %}

I take it that an adequate account of the discourse dynamics of the [Bears](#bears) dialogue ought to respect these observations. In the remainder of this paper, I examine two extant proposals in the literature and contend that neither captures these observations in their entirety. My preferred analysis is based upon the collaborative update framework, supplementing it with an analysis of {% include concept.html word="bare plurals." base="" e="" %}

## Question/answer congruence

A salient feature of the Bears discourse is the presence of focus on *grizzly* in the response utterance. Focus is a lingusitic tool whose use serves primarily to *package* information as opposed to providing its own contribution. It distinguishes the elements of a sentence that are new to the discussion from those that have already been introduced, thus showing to the other participants in the discourse how the contribution is intended to fit in with what has preceeded. In this sense, focus has a distinctly *backward looking* function. It depends on, and responds to, previous moves in the conversation. So it makes sense that the most common analyses of focus interpretation asign it a *presuppositional* semantic function. Focus adds a *felicity condition* to the overall import of a sentence; the sentence is interpretable in situ only if material matching the focus semantic value of the sentence can be found in the previously constructed conversation.

The star bit of data that is marshalled in support of this proposal is that of question/answer congruence. Questions are generally understood to have as their semantic value, the set of propositions that constitute answers to the question; alternatively, a set of resulutions of the issue raised by the question {% include ref.html id="hamblin1958,groenendijk1984" o="n" e="," %}. The most popular account of focus, due to Mats Rooth {% include ref.html id="rooth1992" o="" e="," %} assigns as the semantic value of focus, an alternative set generated by replacing the focused element of a sentence with elements from the domain (of the same type as the focused element and constrained by context). The account predicts that a focused sentence will count as a felicitous response to a question only when the focus is positioned in such a way that the generated alternative set matches the semantic value of the preceeding question. And the prediction bears out.

The star bit of data that is marshalled in support of this proposal is that of question/answer congruence. Compare the responses to the following question:

{% include ex1.html sent='Who ate the last cookie?' sub='[Caitlin]<sub>f</sub> ate the last cookie,Caitlin ate the last [cookie]<sub>f</sub>' term="cookie" %} 

While response (i) is a perfectly natural answer, the placement of focus in (ii) makes it stand out as unacceptable.  Following {% include ref.html id="hamblin1958" o="n" e="," %} a (suitably contextually constrained) semantic value for question A might be:

(A') {_Albert ate the last cookie_, _Betsy ate the last cookie_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

And, the proposed analysis of focus renders the following focus semantic values for the given responses:

a. {_Albert ate the last cookie_, _Betsy ate the last cookie_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

b. {_Caitlin ate the last apple_, _Caitlin ate the last beet_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

The alternative set generated by the focus in (i) is the same as the semantic value for question A, and that generated by the focus in (ii) is not.  Add in the proposed felicity condition, and you have a great explanation of question/answer congruence.

## The problem of contrastive topic

Analyzing focus interpretation in terms of a pragmatic rule connecting focus semantic values to semantic antecedents in prior discourse is incredibly fruitful. But now consider the following example:

{% include ex1.html sent='What did people bring to the picinic?' sub='The [children]<sub>cf</sub> brought [unbridled enthusiasm]<sub>f</sub>' term="picnic" %}

This response involves two focused elements. For both elements, it is easy enough to generate the requisite alternative sets, and alternative set generated for the second focused element (marked with a subscripted *f*), is perfectly congruent with the preceding question. But a difficulty arises when we attempt to apply the felicity condition to the element labeled with *cf* (for *contrastive focus*). Its alternative set is distinctly not congruent with the preceding question, so we would expect the entire utterance to be marked as infelicitous.

Daniel Buring [buering2003] has supplied us with a technique to locate the requisite antecedent.  Building on the notion of the question under discussion developed by Cragie Roberts [roberts1998], Buring posits the existence of a *discourse tree*, which provides structure for the inquiry being undertaken. Each question governing the inqury is a node in the tree and is associated with an array of subquestions, complete answers to which constitute partial answers to the parent question.  The idea is that the subquestions provide a _plan of inquiry_ for addressing the parent question. The objective of the inquiry is to answer the top-most question in the tree. The plan for doing so is to answer each of the subquestions in turn.

But how should we apply this porposal to the current case, where contrastive focus is present without any explicit question? We can, of course, appeal again to the ever present implicit question under discussion. All discourses, it would be maintained, whether questions have been explicitly introduced or not, are governed by a plan of inquiry, which is structured by questions, implicit if need be. Then, the explanation of the contrastive topic in (@bears) would be that the original assertion offers an answer to a parent question, and the correction that follows rejects this answer, replacing it with an answer to a subquestion.

This proposal certainly fits with the structure of the question under discussion representation of the conversational scoreboard. But we may be left a little unsatisfied with the details.  First, it seems to be straining the notion of presupposition pretty heavily. Not only is there no direct representation to stand as antecedent to the generated focus semantic value, [AS WAS POINTED OUT EARLIER] contrastive topic is quite resiliant to infellicity.  Many different potential elements could have been fellicitously focused, and it's hard to see how the conversational scoreboard could have all of these options ready to hand. The common response to this sort of worry is to appeal to accommodation. If the scoreboard does not contain the d-tree needed to provide the antecedent for the contrastive focus, then straightaway it comes about. This reliance on accommodation is not without its own set of issues, predominantly stemming from the unconstrained character of accommodation as a theoretical posit.

But what I take to be the central issue with this sort of approach to the problem of contrastive topic in corrections is a conceptual one having to do with the role of corrections in discourse evolution. The question under discussion model of contrastive topic makes the discourse contribution of contrastive topic entirely backward looking. Whatever role the focus plays is just a matter of checking prior discourse for an antecedent to the focus generated alternative set. 

## Plurals and precision

The general collaborative update framework forms the backbone of the analysis of [Bears](#bears) via the addition of sandboxes and evolving content (modifiable saturation). But the nature of the saturation is determined by the semantic structure of the particular utterance involved.

Bare plurals are treated as generalized quantifiers with universal force subject to variable refinement. Bare plurals are, in this sense, variably strict.
