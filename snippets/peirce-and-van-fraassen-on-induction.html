<p>Peirce thought of inductive, or <em>synthetic</em>, reasoning as making an ampliative inference about unobserved items on the basis of observed ones. It is the reasoning involved when one generalizes from facts about a sample to facts about the entire population.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this case the facts summed up in the conclusion are not among those stated in the premisses. They are different facts, as when one sees that the tide rises <em>m</em> times and concludes that it will rise the next time. These are the only inferences which increase our real knowledge, however useful the others may be. (The probability of induction, p. 181)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While individual such inferences cannot be made free of error, the enterprise of engaging in such reasoning is justified because it is <em>self-corrective</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Induction is the experimental testing of a theory. The justification of it is that, although the conclusion at any stage of the investigation may be more or less erroneous, yet the further application of the same method must correct the error. (5.145)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This account of induction and its grounding is an example of the motivation implicit in what Bas van Fraassen (<a id="vanfraassen2000" class="ref tooled" href="#ref-vanfraassen2000"><span class="date"><span class="year">2000</span></span></a>) has called the <em>First Way</em>:</p>

<!-- Van Fraassen's first way -->
<blockquote>
  <p>An epistemology must imply that, and show how, epistemic security is humanly attainable by the methods of the sciences, under favorable conditions, and that it is in fact attained to some reasonable degree. Security means here, possibly knowledge, perhaps certainty, but at least reliable and accurate beliefs and opinions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But an epistemology based on the security of ampliative reasoning is bound to be ungrounded, for reasons that Peirce well understood:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The relative probability of this or that arrangement of Nature is something which we should have a right to talk about if universes were as plenty as blackberries, if we could put a quantity of them in a bag, shake them up well, draw out a sample, and examine them to see what proportion of them had one arrangement and what proportion another. But, even in that case, a higher universe would contain us, in regard to whose arrangements the conception of probability could have no applicability.</p>

  <p>We have examined the problem proposed by the conceptualists, which, translated into clear language, is this: Given a synthetic conclusion; required to know out of all the possible states of things how many will accord, to any assigned extent, with this conclusion; and we have found that it is only an absurd attempt to reduce synthetic to analytic reason, and that no definite solution is possible.

</blockquote>

<p>Of course, Peirce’s self-correction thesis can be maintained so long as we guarantee that Nature cooperates, and we can do this by switching her out with a proxy of our own creation. Peirce is none too opposed to the switch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though a synthetic inference cannot by any means be reduced to deduction, yet that the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead. That belief gradually tends to fix itself under the influence of inquiry is, indeed, one of the facts with which logic sets out. (The probability of induction, pp. 188-9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a thorough-going pragmatism regarding <em>reality</em>, and it certainly avoids the worry about Nature’s cooperation. But setting aside the decision to play another game altogether, the problem is that there is nothing internal to the enterprise of induction that can guarantee it is applied only in the safe scenarios.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we use induction (generalization from known examples, extrapolation from observed frequencies) it sometimes works and sometimes does not. Can induction tell us when this sort of extrapolation will succeed and when it won’t? This is the place where science has something to tell us: if science is true, success will depend on facts of microstructure and cosmic structure which cannot be among the input for human induction. So the answer is No: induction cannot tell us which applications of induction will succeed.

</blockquote>

<p>Nor is there anything external to the enterprise that performs the same function – other than, that is, luck.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given that traditional epistemology embodies false hopes never to be satisfied, we must try to find a different view of our epistemic condition, with new hopes and new dreams of its own. So here is our tragic protagonist, thrown into a world she never made, and she asks us: What does it take?</p>

  <p>We answer her: it takes luck, courage, and technique; but the greatest of these is luck. (<a id="vanfraassen2000" class="ref tooled" href="#ref-vanfraassen2000"><span class="author">van Fraassen</span><span class="date"><span class="year">2000</span></span><span class="pages">,  273</span></a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so, to move beyond deduction, and genuinely increase our knowledge, we must be courageous – believing beyond our right to certainty – and we must also be lucky – finding ourselves in a circumstance where our courageous leaps are rewarded. Foregoing the blind scramble for security and succumbing to the necessity of luck is not, however, a submission to skepticism. For luck is not blind, and it has a tendency to open its arms and soften our fall.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If our pursuit of knowledge, however broadly or feebly construed, is to be successful, we must be lucky – we have no way to constrain such fortune. This is the verdict on modern philosophy’s misguided search for security. The history of Earth has seen great disasters that spelled the extinction of almost all life, including the dominant, best adapted among species. In each case, some forms of life happened to be suited to the radically and suddenly transformed circumstances – thus evolution on Earth continued after all. See who was lucky and who was not! Look to those survivors, they weave not; neither do they spin; but fortune smiles on them. (<a id="vanfraassen2000" class="ref tooled" href="#ref-vanfraassen2000"><span class="author">van Fraassen</span><span class="date"><span class="year">2000</span></span><span class="pages">,  273</span></a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lucky ones are the survivors. They have no claim to having earned the traits that led them to survive, but they have the traits none the less. Thus, mechanisms of ampliative reasoning can provide a semblance of security, just not security in their lasting security. So long as we acknowledge their domain specificity and resign ourselves to their being subject to the whims of fortune, we can embrace them and reason with them while we remain so fortunate.</p>
