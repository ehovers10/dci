<p>The guiding idea of this investigation is that our formal model of inquiry captures, structurally, the end of inquiry. Levi is not completely dismissive of the role striving for truth can play in inquiry. He suggests that an inquirer <em>X</em></p>

<p>Lip service is certainly being paid to the goal of acquiring truths, but this goal is given second class standing when it comes to the structure of inquiry. Levi draws a distinction between what he calls <em>equilibrium conditions</em> on rationality – commitments that an agent acquires as a basis of logic given that they possess a particular belief corpus – and commitments that the individual bears in virtue of her <em>cognitive goals</em>. The commitment to believing <em>p &amp; q</em> when you believe <em>p</em> and believe <em>q</em> qualifies as an equilibrium condition. But the commitment to, for instance, maintaining a consistent belief corpus is derived from a cognitive goal. Levi sees no reason not to include the inconsistent state among the complete set of information states, though he agrees that one would be well advised both to revise away from it when one finds oneself in that state and also to avoid revising into it when one is considering a transition. The difference is that this advice stems from the <em>goal</em> of inquiry as avoiding error. The inconsistent state is guaranteed to contain error; in so far as one is motivated by this goal in their inquiry, one ought to be motivated to avoid inconsistency.</p>

<p>The implication is that while equilibrium conditions receive direct representation in the inquiry structure – by way of the deductive closure constraint on viable information states and the properties of the revision operator – mere cognitive goal-generated constraints do not. In so far as striving for truth is classified as a cognitive goal, it is precluded from representation in the structure of inquiry.</p>

<p>Restricting the structural representation of inquiry on the basis of this distinction, however, is unmotivated. The question of how best to represent inquiry is the very topic of investigation, and principles of consistency, for instance, seem antecedently as central to proper inquiry as conjunctive syllogism. There is no intuitive difference in significance between equilibrium conditions and cognitive-goal generated constraints. By labeling them <em>goal</em> generated constraints, Levi seems to signify that they are somehow agent-specific in a way that equilibrium conditions are not. We definitely want to restrict our logical structure to topic-neutral categories of reasoning, but the relevant notion of topic-neutrality is not clearly specified. There’s no saying that certain equilibrium conditions wouldn’t fail to satisfy any definition that is provided. While certain goals do not deserve representation in the logical structure of inquiry, demand for consistency is as universal as we can hope for, and James’ defense of the will to believe suggests that the impetus to revise is similarly universal.</p>

<p>Perhaps equilibrium conditions are to be understood as invoking isolated adjustments to a portion of an information state, whereas cognitive goal generated commitments are holistic in that they make essential reference to properties of information states themselves. Even if this distinction can be upheld, it does not carry the weight needed to exclude cognitive goal constraints from representation in the structure of inqury. There is nothing precluding inquiry from being self-referential, taking information states themselves as inputs to the revision process. We may even find that that there are gains in efficiency to be had by being able to reference entire information states in the course of inquiry.</p>

<p>Nor is the atomic/holistic distinction adhered to in Levi’s explicit position on inquiry. He thinks it is a fault of other discussions of inquiry that they treat revisions as adding or subtracting individual beliefs from a corpus. Instead, for Levi, revision does not take place by adding or subtracting single sentences from a corpus, it is always a “set of sentences of propositions added to a corpus to make a deductively closed set” (<a id="levi1980" class="ref tooled" href="#ref-levi1980"><span class="date"><span class="year">1980</span></span><span class="pages">,  27</span></a>).</p>

<p>Be this as it may, Levi worries that striving for truth is relevantly different from error-avoidance; he sees the goal of truth acquisition as topic-specific while the goal of error avoidance is universal. Structural elements of inquiry ought to have universal application, so if there is no universal way to represent the goal of truth acquisition, then it is not a structural element of inquiry. Levi is right that the particular demands of acquiring truth will depend on the topic of investigation, but so, too, do the demands of error avoidance. What matters is whether we can introduce structural elements to model the general process of truth acquisition, just as the revision operator models the process of error avoidance. If a theoretically virtuous (simple, unifying, productive) model can be provided, there seems to be no principled reason of barring the antecedently motivated goal of truth acquisition from inclusion in the structure of inquiry.</p>

<p>We ought also to let the demands of empirical coverage guide our thoeretical posits. I take it that conversation realizes inquiry, and as such analysis of the distribution of expressions in conversation bears on the nature of inquiry. If our best theories of particular lingusitic expressions reference semantic structures that walk and quack like cognitive goal-generated commitments, then inquiry ought to accommodate them. Such expressions are waddling all over the place: Modals (Swanson), Evidentials (Murray), Speech acts (Portner, Starr), Conditionals (??).</p>

<p>As we will see in <a href="#/chapters/collaborative-discourse-dynamics.html">the next chapter</a>, despite the self-referential nature of these rules, the representation of them within our logic is not different in kind from the representation of more localized updates. As such, another avenue for drawing the distinction between equilibrium conditions and goal-generated constraints is shut off.</p>
