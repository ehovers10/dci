### Grades of self-reference

+ Inquiry is both synchronically and diachronically self-referential.
+ Synchronic self-reference is represented by tests on information states. The state as a whole is checked for some property, rather than directly adjusting its membership
+ Diachronic self-reference involves revision on the basis of phases of the state evolution either prior to or in the future of the state at which the revision is applied.
+ The most common diachronic self-referential mechanism is presupposition. 
+ But conjecture and correction are also diachronicly self-referential mechanisms. Conjecture demands a future (perhaps trivial) revision, and correction references past states in its revision.
+ Assertion and questioning, too, are diachronic, but they are predominantly trivially so, they require only acceptance or rejection.

## The discourse contribution of *knows that*

If knowledge is represented by discourse level information states, and "knows that" expresses the knowledge relation, then "knows that" makes a self-referential contribution to discourse. 

There is a lot of precedent for this sort of expression
