## Mapping Lewis' Perspective on Lingusitic theory

### A debate on objectives (Hamm, Kamp, van Lambalgan)

#### Realistic

> Realistic semantics conceives of semantics as characterising the relationship between linguistic expressions and reality.... It is not about psychological or sociological facts concerning the use of a linguistic system but about the relationship of an abstract linguistic system to aspects of the world. The conclusion is that the relationship between language considered as an abstract system and the world is at least in principle independent of meanings grasped by a mind. (p. 1)

Basic concepts: reference, truth, inference

#### Cognitive

> Cognitive oriented research in semantics considers the investigation of the relationship between natural language expressions and mental structures as the major topic of semantic research. Conceptual structures are generated -- similarly to phrase structures by phrase structure grammars in syntax -- by an algorithmic device. Therefore semantics constitutes a generative domain of its own, independent of syntax to which it is linked by so called correspondence rules. (p. 2)

Basic concepts: event, thing, path

### A matter of methodology

Scoreboard and best systems.

Theoretical identification.

ICC and need for propositions

The question is not one of what semantics is after, but whether semantic theory makes essential reference to representational elements
