## Contextualism and relativism

If Brisco and Green both believe that they've got the culprit, then they will act in similar ways. They'll look to elicit a confession, offer up bargains, or threaten physical violence. But if Brisco's suspect is in confession room A while Green's is in B, then their actions will have quite different import.[^brisco] In one sense, Brisco and Green believe the same thing, but in another sense, they believe differently.

The fact that sameness of belief is two-sided in this way is brought out in the differences between a relativist and a contextualist approach to attitude ascriptions such as *Brisco believes that the culprit acted alone*. Relativists take belief to be a relation to a property -- one that a person stands in when she self-ascribes that property.[^centeredworlds] The agreement between Brisco and Green then comes from their both self-ascribing the property of *currently interrogating the culprit*. Their disagreement comes from the fact that Brisco self-ascribes the property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room A* and Green self-ascribes the property of *inhabiting a world where the culprit is in interrogation room B*. Since individual people don't co-locate, they can't both possess their respective properties in actuality.

The contextualist views the situation differently. Belief, for the contextualist, is a relation between an individual and a proposition. But context infects the relation as well, and the relations one bears to a proposition need not be stable across changes in context.[^contextualistflavor] So, Brisco and Green definitely disagree.  Hold the context fixed, and Brisco stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room A*, while Green stands in the belief relation to the proposition that *the culprit is in interrogation room B*. Since individual people don't co-locate, they cannot both, in actuality, believe true things. But, it may yet *appear* that they agree. After all, both Brisco and Green would honestly tell the Liutenant "I'm subjecting the culprit to interrogation." But the contextualist denies that honest reporting tells the whole story. Our words are sensitive to context in a way that our beliefs are not. Their espousal of the same belief is merely superficial.

The difference is one way of cashing out the difference between relativist and contextualist views of attitudes. But this is not the only way.

### Disagreement as lingusitic data

Disagreement has been a bit of a star figure in recent debates in the philosophy of language. Primarily, it has been used as a tool for assessing the adequacy of different proposals for the semantic contribution of certain expressions. The contestants in battle disagreement are *absolutism*, *contextualism*, and *relativism*, and the standard scorecard has absolutism and relativism coming out on top in virtue of their ability to secure constant content across uses of the expression. Genuine disagreement does seem to require something toward which utterances can entail incompatible commitments, but semantic content is not the only contribution an utterance makes to discourse. Contextualism can appeal other elements of utterances, which may both remain constant and serve as the seat of disagreement.

### Commitment and contribution

Plunkett and Sundell

The difference between contextualism and relativism is generally couched in terms of content, but content is not the only semantically relevant element of linguistic utterances. Also associated with what we say is a context change potential. A different way of representing the difference between contextualism and relativism is not in terms of what they mean but what they do.

### The nature of relativism

John MacFarlane characterizes as relativistic any semantic theory that makes essential reference to the context of the <em>assessor</em> of an utterance. And much of the contextualism/relativism debate has centered on who's context matters. But Peter Lasersohn provided an interestingly different take on relativism. His support of relativism was not so much that certain expressions demand that the assessor's context be included but that whose context is important to evaluation is not <em>determined</em> at the point of utterance.

### Joint inquiry and relativism

Joint inquiry, modeled by sandbox-level investigation, suggests exactly this. An individuals utterance is incomplete in an important way, and it calls for completion from one's interlocutors. Thus, evaluation is delayed until the inquiry progresses.  Knowledge, it turns out, is relative; just not in the way we first suspected.

[^brisco]:
    In one sense, Brisco and Green disagree in their beliefs. Brisco thinks it was the guy in room A that did it, while Green thinks it was the one in room B. They both think that the person who did it acted alone. In another sense, they agree in what they believe.  Belief is functionally tied to action, and Brisco and Green are acting in very similar ways. While Brisco is putting the screws to the guy in room A, Green has got the guy in room B under a hot lamp. They both have drafted warrant requests, and have finger prints running through the database checker.

[^centeredworlds]:
    Perhaps not all relativists would be happy with this characterization, taking belief to be a three-place relation among a subject, proposition, and a perspective. But a perspectival proposition is itself a relation; curry that relation and you're left with a property.

[^contextualistflavor]:
    There are different flavors of contextualism (Stanley, DeRose, Glanzberg, etc) and the differences might make a difference for certain applications. But I'm happy to treat the version in the text as representative in regard to the issue of disagreement.
