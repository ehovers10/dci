Radical interpretation

P: the whole truth about a speaker as a physical system, our entire base of data
Ao: the set of attitudes of the speaker expressed in our language
Ak: the set of attitudes of the speaker expressed in their language
M: the meanings of his meaningful expressions

Radical interpretation: **Given P, solve for the rest**

> It should be obvious by now that my problem of radical interpretation is not any real-life task of finding out about Karl's beliefs, desires, and meanings. I am not really asking how *we* could determine these facts. Rather: how do *the facts* determine these facts? By what constraints, and to what extent, does the totality of physical facts about Karl determine what he believes, desires, and means? To speak of a mighty knower, who uses his knowledge of these constraints to advance from omniscience about the physical facts **P** to omniscience about the other facts determined thereby, is a way of dramatizing our problem.... The real-life knower has all the problems of our fictitious [omniscient] knower, and more besides: he does not have all of **P** to draw on, and he may be limited in endurance, intelligence, or memory.... But these further obstacles to his investigation are irrelevant to our real topic. (pp. 333-4)

> What are the constraints by which the problem of radical interpretation is to be solved? Roughly speaking, they are the fundamental principles of our general theory of persons. They tell us how beliefs and desires and meanings are normally related to one another, to behavioral output, and to sensory input.
  
Principle of charity: The system imputes to Karl beliefs and desires that are more or less the beliefs and desires we would have were we to be in Karl's shoes, broadly construed.

Rationalization Principle: The system imputes to Karl beliefs and desires that represent him as rational; they give him good reason for performing the actions he does perform.

The principle of Truthfulness: The system imputes meanings that accord with Karl participating in a convention of truthfulness with other speakers of his language.

The Principle of Generativity: The complete system of meanings is at least finitely specifiable, and perhaps also "reasonably uniform and simple".

THe Manifestation Principle: The system imputes to Karl beliefs and desires that are manifest in his dispositions to speech behavior.

The Triangle Principle: "Karl's beliefs and desires should be the same whether expressed in his language or in ours."

The concepts of belief, desire, and meaning are so well confirmed as to be given status within any theory of interpretation. They are bedrock in our common sense theory of persons. But so, too, is the theory of language as a tool used by individuals in real time. And adding this to the specification of interpretation both further constrains acceptable interpretations and expands the realm of the explanandum. That is, it changes the rules of radical interpretation, radically. No what we are after is not a best system derived from all the physical evidence at anyone's disposal. But a system designed by us with an eye toward its ability to be used as it is used by the subject of our studies, namely, us.

The rise of dynamism in linguistic theory highlights the significance of the challenge to Lewis' specification of the problem. For the feedback loops are legion, sentence meanings in context can be non-persistant, and, I claim, the meaning of an utterance can evolve after it has been spoken and entered into the record.


**Method 1**

1. Fill in Ao by means of *charity*.
2. Using Ao and dispositions to speech behavior in P, fill in the beliefs in Ak by means of *manifestation*.
3. Revise the beliefs in Ao and fill in M by a process of reflective equilibrium in such a way as *triangularity* is satisfied and balance between *charity* and *generativity* is maintained.
4. Use Ao and P broadly to revise the desires in Ao by means of *rationalization*. Use the result to fill in the desires of Ak.
5. Test the revision of Ao to see if it affects the result of step 2 and repeat until a stable solution is reached.

**Method 2**

1. Fill in Ao by means of *rationalization* and *charity* using both behavioral and life history information drawn from P.
2. Fill in M using Ao by means of *truthfulness* first and *generativity* second.
3. Fill in Ak using Ao and M by means of *triangularity*.

**Method 3**

Holism: do it all at once, best we can, using all the evidence and constraints available.

Lewis on indeterminacy: Deny that we've captured all the constraints rather than deny that we've incorrectly imagined the whole process.

Dynamism and collaboration call for adjustments to the conceived constraints, if not additions to them:
  
+ Generativity: specification of simplification in terms of usability constraint.
+ Truthfulness: honesty and mutual trust
+ Rationality: dynamic, principles of inquiry

But it also calls into question the fixed points that get the project of radical interpretation up and rolling in the first place: that beliefs, desires, and truth-conditional utterances are all we have to work with.

The collaborative model presumes an enlarged set of relevant data from P, and the previous chapter was an attempt to motivate its inclusion as a starting point.
