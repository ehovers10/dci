Farkas and Bruce provide a scoreboard-type model on which utterances project a modification to the common ground based on the default response to the utterance. But the projection set does not directly modify the common ground; it is used for assessing the utterance, but different responses to the utterance (acceptance, rejection, something in between) result in different impact on the common ground.

Fox introduces the notion of reconstruction, in which the representation of an utterance (its meaning, at any level of analysis) changes over the course of the dialogue. It requires a model that not only allows a speaker to alter the course of future dialogue by judicious introduction to the context, they can also alter the past representation by reconstructing a representation already present. The crucial elements of a model for this are indeterminacy and storage in short-term memory. Utterances project certain sets of future utterances, but the set is not determinate, and over time it can become evident that a different set is required; discursants then have the ability to go back to the original utterance and reconstruct it with a different set of follow ups.

Grosz, Sidner, Kraus, and Lochbaum develop a model of Shared Plans applied to discourse, in which multiple agents have a shared intention and individually contribute actions toward that intention.

Clark, Schelgloff, and Sacks present data on and develop a model of extended multi-party discourse in which a project, such as referring, is not undertaken by a single speaker, but is a joint effort by multiple parties to the conversation. Reference requires both an initiation and a recognition, and there may be intermediary discussion to ensure that recognition is mutually achieved. The notion of side sequences is vital to the model. Strings of discourse interrupt the main thread to ensure that recognition is achieved on one item within the thread.

Reichman builds discourse on context spaces, interleaved, extended representations that show the structural complexity of discourse. Bits of discourse are not added to the representation in simple sequence; rather, some bits are related to other bits in ways that unify them within a single context space. Context spaces as a whole have impacts on the discourse in ways different than the impact of individual utterances.

Our concern in theorizing about communicative exchange is in the dynamic development of the discourse. How do interlocutors use what has preceded the current point in the exchange to advance it toward their goal of engaging in the exchange.

Collaborative update, because it is enmeshed in a serial exchange, necessarily proceeds in a series of tries and corrections. Accommodating this in the logical structure demands a higher level of dynamism.

Statics
  + Given a complete transcript and some basic features of the context, a third party could construct the meaning after the fact
  + The sole concern in meaning is truth conditions; supplied with context, this gives us truth.
  + Meaning depends only on truth conditions and features of the context in which the utterance is made (or assessed).

Dynamics 1
  + Meaning is a function that is supplied with an information state and outputs a new state.
  + Meaning depends on factors beyond the context of utterance (or assessment).
  + Units of meaning are multi-sentence sequences.
  + Semantic binding outstrips syntactic binding.
  + Meaning is a function of context.
  + Facts about the use of a sentence impact its meaning.
  
Dynamics 2
  + Meaning can change throughout the course of the discourse.
