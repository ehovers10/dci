### Models

Collaborative update is built upon a tradition of compositional semantics, founded in the Fregean tradition: the meaning of a complex expression is fully determined by the meaning of its parts together with their mode of combination. Basic linguistic elements are supplied with basic meanings and complex linguistic elements have meanings derived from these through combinatorial principles, foremost of which being *function application*. Whatever else they are, basic semantic objects are elements of sets. Complex semantic objects are set-theoretic constructs of basic elements.

A *model* for the language supplies the elements needed to generate semantic objects of all sorts. A *universe* for the model is a set of basic objects. A *valuation function* assigns objects from the universe to basic syntactic objects. A separate function, an *assignment function*, assigns objects domain to any variables called for in the semantic rules. This separation of assignment tasks allows us to fix a model and consider variation of parts within that partial fixing, a tool that is useful for making sense of *generalization* in language. The *grammar* of a language is a set of rules explaining how to derive a semantic object for any syntactic object made possible by the syntax rules for the language. Basic and constructed semantic objects are optionally *typed*. Typing allows us to add nuance to both valuation and the semantic rules. Rules can be qualified to apply only to objects of certain types. These qualifications provide a means of explaining the distribution of certain expressions in natural language in terms of their combinatorial properties (the sets of rules that apply to them).

*Semantic values* are the objects assigned to expressions on the basis of the semantic rules and a particular model. By relativizing semantic value to a model we explain how language is sensitive to a context in which it is applied. Language use draws on specifics of the particular speech setting (what extra-linguistic objects are salient in the setting, what properties the participants to the conversation have and and what relations they stand in to each other) to fill out the general rules of language interpretation. Relativization to a model paritally explicates this concretization function of interpretation, placing the interpretation within a *context*. Deictic pronouns and quantifier domain restriction provide application for this use of context, as does precisification of vague predicates. We may find call to further relativize semantic value to specific aspects of the context, to make sense of expressions whose interpretation asks us to consider, from within a particular context, evaluation at other contexts. Such *shifty* expressions require the interpreter to fix a specific element from the domain as the home base from which interpretation will take place. Typing is again relevant here, as the rules for shifty expressions commonly select what is being shifted by reference to its type. The most common kind of shifty expression is that associated with *counterfactual* reasoning; for this reason, semantic values are frequently relativized to a situation-type object in addition to the model and assignment function relativization.

### Dynamics

While model theoretic semantics provides an immensely fruitful framework for semantic research, it has specific limitations. 
### Structuring --> Partition maps (Hoversten, retraction?)

We introduced a means of proposing to capture a distinction in the way that conversation progresses. Utterances can both add information directly to the common ground and propose information for addition that only gets so added as the conversation further evolves. This is an additional form of dynamics.

But information is not the only thing that can potentially evolve during conversation. Structuring itself is open to cooperative modification (acceptance/denial).

### Update vs. dynamics

Dynamic semantics treats semantic value as a function from contexts to contexts.

Contexts are assignment functions. Uttering a sentence in conversation has the effect of replacing one assignment function with another that resembles it in ways specified by the semantic value of the sentence. (Maintains continuity with the previous function.) The function switch changes the value that certain variables are assigned. Each dynamic addition to the conversation rewrites the
