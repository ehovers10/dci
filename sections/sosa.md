> What precludes our conceiving of knowledge in a similar way, as a desideratum that includes an intrinsic success component, a hitting of the mark of truth, along with how one accomplishes that, how one succeeds in hitting the mark of truth? On this conception, knowledge is not just hitting the mark but hitting the mark somehow through means proper and skillful enough. There seems nothing “incoherent” in any pejorative sense in such a desideratum of “knowledge,” and there are plenty of analogous desiderata throughout the wide gamut of human endeavors.

The further value might rather be just praxical value or the like.
