Raising an issue is a discourse level move that needs to be represented on the conversational scoreboard. It is not adequately represented by a restriction of the common ground.

Murray, Groenendijk and Roelofsen
  + Structuring update
  + Partitions the common ground

Farkas and Bruce
  + Issue added to table
  + Sentence syntactic representation + speech-act marker
  + Content of sentence, which is a set of propositions

Differences
  + relation-in-extension vs. relation-in-intension
  + simplicity vs. structural complexity
  + expressive power in witness only in the case of dynamic development of the discourse


One way of representing issue raising is by way of what Murray has called *structuring updates* -- the common ground is structured without affecting its membership. The effect is the same as Groenendijk's (inquisitive semantics) approach, which formally involves imposing an equivalence relation on the common ground. Resolving the issue is then a matter of selecting a preferred cell of the partition and removing the rest from the common ground. Alternatively, removing relational pairs rather than individual worlds.

Another way is by adding an additional component to the scoreboard to keep track of raised issues, which can be represented in different ways. Farkas and Bruce (and similarly, Roberts) suggest that we represent a table that carries a stack of issue-raising sentences paired with their contents. This stack can then be put to use to generate various modifications of the common ground. Issue resolution is a matter of removing issue markers from the table.

It is tempting to think that these two versions are merely formal variants -- that both express the same idea. Much as the context set generates the common ground, but the common ground can be used to capture all that is needed. Or that the ordering set is equivalent to a closeness relation. As such, simplicity desiderata speak in favor of the less representationally complex.

At a static level, the two are equivalent. (Though, as Farkas and Bruce point out, representational features of the *sentences* used to express issues may provide interpretational fodder as well.) But dynamically, differences emerge. The difference has to do with the ability the second model has for tracking changes to the common ground, and these are relevant for conversational moves that involve *revisiting* previous moves, such as *retraction*, *retrenchment*, *expansion*.

> For simplicity we assume that the items on the Table form a stack.7 The Table records what is ‘at issue’ in the conversation. When the Table is not empty, the immediate goal of the conversation is to empty it, i.e. to settle the issue at hand. The stack discipline allows us to capture the tight connection between initiating conversational moves, such as an initiating assertion or question, and responding moves that address the issue an immediately preceding utterance has placed on the Table, a matter we come back to in Section 4.

As long as there are items on the Table, there are issues that need to be dealt with. A conversation is in a stable state when its Table is empty; a conversation is at a natural endpoint only when it is stable.
