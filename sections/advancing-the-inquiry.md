### Advancing the inquiry

A conjecture is a kind of conversational move. It is defined in terms of the role it plays in advancing the inquiry in which it occurs. While speech acts are finely individuated, there is a small set of {% gloss contribution' %} types derivable from the goals of inqury.[^ConversationalForce]

The primary goal of inquiry is to come to know something one did not know at its outset. Thus, an individual can advance us toward that goal by submitting (proposing) information to be taken on as mutually accepted. We call this kind of contribution an {% gloss assertion.' %}

The end point of an inquiry depends in part on its starting point, which is the *issue* that is to be resolved by the process of inquiry. An individual can submit a new issue to the inquiry to be taken on as providing a new goal for the inquiry.  We call this contribution a {% gloss question' %}.[^command][^mood]

These commonly cited examples do not provide an exhaustive list of conceptually possible contribution types. I don't intend to provide identity conditions for types of contribution, but the examples do share certain things in common, and their common traits can provide us with criteria for recognizing novel contribution types.

+ Genuine contribution types *operate on* {% gloss *information*' %} in a distinctive way. Assertions expand the context set, and questions partition it. The currency of inquiry is information, and its value is tied to the ways in which information can be put to use to advance the inquiry toward its goal.
+ Conversational moves that contribute to inquiry *anticipate an appropriate response*, and *place constraints on the form of the response*. Assertion anticipates either acceptance or rejection of the asserted content, and (modulo repair tactics for failed presuppositions) restricts responses to either acceptance or rejection. Questions anticipate an answer, and restrict responses to those assertions that at least partially resolve the issue raised.[^QACongruence]
+ Genuine contribution types are performed by way of a *conventionalized linguistic tool*. If a contribution belongs to a specific type, language will have found a way to implement that type. Assertions and questions are stronly tied to linguistic mood, although the connection between these contribution types and mood is a tricky one {% cite portner1997,starr2010 %}.

I maintain that conjecture, when paired with a corresponding correction, constitutes a distinct, genuine contribution type. Conjecture is similar to assertion in that it seems to provide a proposal of added information. And similarly to questions, conjectures seem to present an issue that is up for further discussion.[^supposition] But conjectures are distinct from each of these, and call for a unique treatment.  That they earn such status is what I hope to show throughout the course of this project.

[^command]:
    Sometimes added to this list of contribution types is the *command*, which proposes a non-linguistic demand upon a participant in the inquiry. The appropriate response to such a contribution is to make the world such that the demand is met (or to reject the demand itself).

[^mood]:
    Each of these contribution types has an associated linguistic mood. Inquiry is a structured process, in which it is important not only what information is available but also how it is to be put to use in reaching the goal. As an implementation of inquiry, linguistic discourse has conventional means of representing how the information is being put to use by a contribution. But the scope of contribution types is not limited by the set of conventional moods. Nor do I think the concept of *linguistic mood* cuts along the same joints as that of *contribution type*. What is important for a contribution type is that there is a recognizably unique way in which information is put to use to further the goals of the inquiry.

[^supposition]:
    They are also similar to suppositions in that they seem to be less than fully committal on the part of the speaker. Assertion is generally associated with a commitment that it generates for the speaker.  This commitment involves some evidential relation between the asserter and the information conveyed, though it is controversial just what relation it is. But whatever the relation amounts to, it seems clear that we sometimes offer contributions to discourse that go beyond the evidence we have available. And we do this not just as a means of flouting the rules of discourse, but frequently in order to respect the project of the communicative exchange.

[^ConversationalForce]:
    The notion in the text of *contribution type* is related to Paul Portner's *conversational force*, which he sees of as a notion, distinct from illocutionary force, that has implications for aspects of the grammatical system relating to syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
