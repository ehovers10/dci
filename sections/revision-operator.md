Expansion is the easier of the two operations to understand. Syntactically, the operation involves adding a sentence to the information state and taking the deductive closure of the result. Semantically, this is just the intersection of the state of information with the state representing the expansion proposition. Given the deductive closure constraint on information states, there is only one viable expansion operation. 

There is more room for nuance in specifying the contraction operation, for there is more than one way to remove information from the information state.[^agm] Rationality does not determine a unique operation on one's state of information in response to removing a belief from consideration. For any instance of contraction, there will be potential belief states that are incompatible but between which there is no way of determining the better and the worse. They are all equally well justified, and since they result from the process of proper inquiry, they are equally states of knowledge.[^multiknowledge]

[^multiknowledge]: It is thus a consequence of Levi's approach to inquiry as transition between states of knowledge following the dictates of a revision operator that there can be multiple, incompatible states of knowledge.

[^agm]: The classic treatment of contraction is AGM (Alchourron 1985), and I refer the reader there for details on the relation.
