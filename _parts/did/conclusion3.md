The sticky situation for the universal interpretation of bare plurals is that sentences like [Hibernate](#hibernating-bears-ex){: #hibernating-bears-show .tooled} can be true even though there are examples of non-hibernating bears, which is to say the the bare plural sentence can be true even though witnesses to its negation exist in the domain. We are alternately pulled between an inclination to view bare plural quantification as strict and an inclination to loosen it up.

The CU extraction stands behind the strictness inclination. Bare plural sentences involve universal quantification, albeit a partitioned version thereof. The resulting puzzle is to explain (or explain away) the looseness inclination. This ultimately involves giving up on the claims that sentences such as [Hibernate](#hibernating-bears-ex){: #hibernating-bears-show .tooled} are true in any rigid sense, but the framework of CU gives us a substitute that makes it easier to let go.

The key observation here is [Susceptibility](#susceptibility-obs){: #susceptibility-show .tooled}. Even if bare plural sentences can be true, their truth seems to be inherently unstable. A shift to a slightly different context
