Delving into the nature of inquiry reveals that it is a <em>collaborative</em> endeavor, which is relativized to a community of inquirers. If knowledge just is the output of this process, then knowledge, too is so relativized. The <em>inquiry-first</em> conception of knowledge, while revisionary, is not so radical. It captures common sense ideas about degrees of cognitive achievement and conceptual refinement, and it offers a unifying account of the diverse ways we talk about knowledge. It is further supported by the promise it carries for explaining the distinctive value of knowledge over true belief.</p> <blockquote> <ul class="section"> <li class="open" id="finding-our-way-to-knowledge">Finding our way to knowledge <img class="icon" src="/images/chevron-down.svg" title="Detail" /></li> <blockquote class="hid item" id="finding-our-way-to-knowledge-hid">Jonathan Schaffer (Knowledge in the image of assertion) has argued that we can learn something about the structure of knowledge by investigating the nature of assertion, to which knowledge bears a substantive connection.

He takes the principal mandate of proper inquiry to be to avoid importing error into one's state of information. Since refusing to alter one's information state guarantees that no additional error will be imported, the maximally conservative inquirer is perfectly rational by the lights of Levi's account. An information state on this model is merely a set of worlds, representing the space of genuine (open) possibilities according to the inquiring agent.</blockquote> <li class="open" id="abduction">Abduction <img class="icon" src="/images/chevron-down.svg" title="Detail" /></li> <blockquote class="hid item" id="abduction-hid">But we aren't satisfied to remain cognitively stationary. In C. S. Peirce's (Fixation of belief) words, we are constantly subject to the <em>irritation of doubt</em>. We can incorporate this impetus to revise our information state into a formal account of inquiry by way of William James' (Will to believe) dual inquiry mandate: avoid error and acquire truth. The impetus to revise stems from the second goal, and the rational inquirer strives for truth in addition to avoiding error.<br/><br/>To model this extension of the nature of inquiry, we add additional structure to the information states that are the objects of inquiry. We partition the space of possibilities based on the issue the agent is striving to resolve.</blockquote> <ul class="subsection"> <li class="open" id="impetus-to-revise">Impetus to revise </li> <li class="open" id="will-to-believe">Will to believe </li> </ul> <li class="open" id="induction">Induction <img class="icon" src="/images/chevron-down.svg" title="Detail" /></li> <blockquote class="hid item" id="induction-hid">An inquiry is not simple transition from one state to the next. It is a dilated process, developing over the course of a number of steps, some of which, perhaps, involve false progress and require the inquirer to backtrack. The process of having reached a dead end in the inquiry often provides valuable information to the inquirer.<br/><br/>Plans require bookkeeping both in the form of preparing multiple lines of progress the inquiry might entertain as it runs its course as well as a record of past steps taken. To account for this, we must expand the information state structure again, modeling this bookkeeping operation.<br/><br/>John Stuart Mill (On Liberty) maintained that the ability to defend one's beliefs against detractors is an essential element of the justification of those beliefs. As the principal justifying process of belief, inquiry thus carries the commitment to engage the best arguments one can find in pursuit of issue resolution. The result is that proper inquiry is essentially a joint activity -- one in which dispute plays a progressive role.<br/><br/>To model joint, disputative inquiry, we need a staging ground upon which attempted information state revisions can be proposed and vetted. I call this platorm a *sandbox*, and it is essentially a mini-information state embedded within the primary one. It allows for extended investigation of issues without potentially infecting the primary information state with false tries.</blockquote> <ul class="subsection"> <li class="open" id="coherence">Coherence </li> <li class="open" id="correction">Correction </li> </ul> <li class="open" id="implementation">Implementation <img class="icon" src="/images/chevron-down.svg" title="Detail" /></li> <blockquote class="hid item" id="implementation-hid">We end up with a picture of inquiry as the productive evolution of an articulated information state. Productive evolution can take a variety of forms. These forms correspond to different types of contribution. Inquiry contribution types have direct analogues in discourse. There are possibility restricting <em>assertions</em> and state partitioning <em>questions</em> with which we are familiar. But there is also a contribution type corresponding to *conjecture*, which can be modeled by sandbox-level investigations. <em>Conjecture</em>, along with its natural pair <em>correction</em>, provides a distinctive means of advancing the inquiry.</blockquote> </ul> <li class="" id="what-do-we-know">What do we know? </li> <ul class="subsection"> <li class="open" id="solitary-knowing">Solitary knowing <img class="icon" src="/images/chevron-down.svg" title="Detail" /></li> <blockquote class="hid item" id="solitary-knowing-hid">Those who do not belong to a community of inquirers have no one against whom to test their beliefs, but surely they are capable of possessing knowledge. Proper inquiry is doubly qualified to account for solitary knowledge: (i) an inquirer need only possess the ability to defend against challenges, and (ii) she need only defend against the best arguments available. Degenerative inquiry, in which the best available arguments are trivially defended, is still inquiry, its outputs still knowledge.</blockquote> <li class="open" id="knowing-the-truth">Knowing the truth <img class="icon" src="/images/chevron-down.svg" title="Detail" /></li> <blockquote class="hid item" id="knowing-the-truth-hid">Everything known is true, but the inquiry-first account posits complex objects that are not identical to truths.

Possessing knowledge is more valuable than possessing merely true belief, but these accounts of knowledge have no explanation for the distinctive value that knowledge provides over and above the truth of output they produce. But the problem isn't with the machine-product model itself. The problem comes from focusing on the product and ignoring the process. The value of knwoledge is in grounding the credit the agent deserves for the belief. Knowledge provides, as Socrates suggested to Meno, an <em>account</em> of the product's genesis. So long as the process is seen as external to the product, the product will carry no value of its own. But the insight of the connection between inquiry and knowledge is that they need not be independent. The product encodes the process. The inquiry itself is the object of knowledge.</blockquote> </ul> <li class="open" id="tracing-back-through-the-breadcrumbs">Tracing back through the breadcrumbs </li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3 class="chapter"><a href="/chapters/collaborative-discourse-dynamics.html">Collaborative discourse dynamics</a></h3> <p>Genuine contributions to discourse change the state of the conversational scoreboard in distinctive ways. Incorporating ideas from version control in computer programming, I develop an update semantics that accommodates collaborative inquiry. In *collaborative update semantics*, contribution operators attach to propositional radicals, and contributions initiated by one utterance may require completion by a later utterance. In particular, conjecture operators function by opening a *sandbox* in which further discourse builds on the conjecture. When all parties are satisfied, the sandbox contents are merged into the original information state, which is additionally marked for the purposes of tracking the changes.</p> <blockquote> <ul class="section"> <li class="" id="scoreboards-and-best-systems">Scoreboards and best systems </li> <ul class="subsection"> <li class="open" id="constructing-an-interpretation">Constructing an interpretation <img class="icon" src="/images/chevron-down.svg" title="Detail" /></li> <blockquote class="hid item" id="constructing-an-interpretation-hid">David Lewis' conception of the conversational scoreboard is grounded in his theory of radical interpretation.
